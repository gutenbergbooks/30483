<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>A Good Little Dream</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;I Elijah Peebles Martin, of the
city and county of Harrison, in the
state of Rhode Island, being of sound and disposing
mind and memory, do make and declare
the following, as and for, my last will and testament.&rsquo; ... I
wish you&rsquo;d take your head
out of that barrel, Nancy, and listen to the document
that is going to make you rich beyond
the dreams of avarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beyond them anyway.&rdquo; The young
woman in blue serge made one last effectual
dive into the depths of excelsior, the topmost
billows of which were surging untidily over the
edge of a big crate in the middle of the basement
floor, and secured a nest of blue and rose
colored teacups, which she proceeded to unwrap
lovingly and display on a convenient packing
box. &ldquo;Not one single thing broken in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' ></a>2</span>
whole lot, Billy.... What is a disposing
mind and memory, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve to know,&rdquo; the blond young
man in the Norfolk jacket assured her, adjusting
himself more firmly to the idiosyncrasies of
the rackety step-ladder he was striding.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not human about this. Here you are
suddenly in possession of a fortune. Money
enough to make you independently wealthy for
the rest of your life&mdash;money you didn&rsquo;t know
the existence of, two weeks ago&mdash;fed to you by
a gratuitous providence. A legacy is a legacy,
and deserves to be treated as such, and I propose
to see that it gets what it deserves, without
any more shilly-shallying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a busy woman,&rdquo; Nancy groaned, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ve hammered my finger to a pulp, trying to
open this crate, while you perch on a broken
step-ladder and prate to me of legacies. The
saucers to these cups may be in here, and I
can&rsquo;t wait to find out. I&rsquo;m perfectly crazy
about this ware. It&rsquo;s English&mdash;Wedgewood,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Billy resignedly let himself
to the floor, and appropriated the screwdriver.
&ldquo;I thought Wedgewood was dove color,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' ></a>3</span>
and consisted chiefly of ladies in deshabille, doing
the tango on a parlor ornament. I smashed
one in my youth, so I know. There, it&rsquo;s open
now. I may as well unpack what&rsquo;s here. These
seem to be demi-tasses.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&lsquo;You may tempt your upper classes,</p>
<p>With your villainous demi-tasses.</p>
<p>But Heaven will protect the working girl,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>he finished lugubriously, in a wailing baritone,
taking an imaginary encore by bowing a head
picturesquely adorned with a crop of excelsior
curls, accumulated during his activities in and
about the barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with the average tea-room, or
Arts and Crafts table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te,&rdquo; Nancy said, sinking
into the depths of a broken armchair in the
corner of the dim, overcrowded interior, &ldquo;is
that when the pinch comes, quantity is sacrificed
to quality. Smaller portions of food, and
chipped chinaware. People who can&rsquo;t keep a
place up, let it run down genteelly. They won&rsquo;t
compromise on quality. I should never be like
that. I should go to the ten-cent stores and
replenish my whole establishment, if I couldn&rsquo;t
make it pay with imported ware and Colonial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' ></a>4</span>
silver. I&rsquo;d never go to the other extreme. I&rsquo;d
never be so perceptibly second-rate, but in the
matter of furnishings as well as food values,
I&rsquo;d find my perfect balance between quality
and quantity, and keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you would. You are a thorough
child, when you set about a thing. I&rsquo;ll bet you
know the restaurant business from A to Z.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. You know, I studied the organization
of every well-run restaurant in New York,
when I was doing field work from Teachers&rsquo;
College. I&rsquo;ve read every book on the subject
of Diet and Nutrition and Domestic Economy
that I could get my hands on. I&rsquo;m just ready
now for the practical application of all my
theories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy Calory Martin is your real name. I
don&rsquo;t blame you for hating to give up this tea-room
idea. You&rsquo;ve dug so deep into the possibilities
of it, that you want to go through. I
get that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s eyes widened in satiric admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could understand almost anything,
couldn&rsquo;t you, Billy?&rdquo; she mocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want now,&rdquo; Billy continued imperturbably,
&ldquo;is a chance to make <i>you</i> understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' ></a>5</span>
something.&rdquo; He smote the document in his left
hand. &ldquo;Of course, your uncle&rsquo;s lawyer has explained
all the details in his letters to you, but
if you won&rsquo;t read the letters or familiarize yourself
with the contents of this will, somebody
has got to explain it to you in words of one syllable.
My legal training, slight as it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sketchy is the better word, don&rsquo;t you think
so, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slight as it is&rdquo;&mdash;except for a prodigious
frown, Billy ignored the interruption, though
he took advantage of her suddenly upright position
to encircle her neatly with a barrel hoop,
as if she were the iron peg in a game of quoits&mdash;&ldquo;enables
me to put the fact before you in a
few short, sharp, well-chosen sentences. I
won&rsquo;t again attempt to read the document&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; Nancy interrupted witheringly,
&ldquo;your delivery is poor. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
want to know what is in that will. If I had, it
stands to reason that I would have found out
long before this. I&rsquo;ve had it three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had it three days and never once
looked into it?&rdquo; Billy groaned. &ldquo;Who started
all this scandal about the curiosity of women,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' ></a>6</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; Nancy
insisted. &ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m not in possession of
any definite facts, I can ignore it. I&rsquo;ve got the
kind of mind that must deal with concrete facts
concretely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate the job of trying to
subp&oelig;na you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d make a corking
good witness, on the stand. Of course, you
can proceed for a certain length of time on the
theory that what you don&rsquo;t know can&rsquo;t hurt
you, but take it from me, little girl, what you
ought to know and don&rsquo;t know is the thing that&rsquo;s
bound to hurt you most tremendously in the
long run. What are you afraid of, anyway,
Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not <i>afraid</i> of anything,&rdquo; Nancy corrected
him, with some heat. &ldquo;I just plain don&rsquo;t
want to be interrupted at this stage of my
career. I consider it an impertinence of Uncle
Elijah, to make me his heir. I never saw him
but once, and I had no desire to see him that
time. It was about ten years ago, and I caught
a grippe germ from him. He told me between
sneezes that I was too big a girl to wear a
mess of hair streaming down my back like a
baby. I stuck out my tongue at him, but he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' ></a>7</span>
too near-sighted to see it. Why couldn&rsquo;t he
have left his money to an eye and ear infirmary?
Or the Sailors&rsquo; Snug Retreat? Or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really don&rsquo;t want the money,&rdquo; Billy
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your privilege to endow some institution&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well that I can&rsquo;t get rid of
money that way,&rdquo; Nancy cried hotly. &ldquo;I am at
least a responsible person. I don&rsquo;t believe in
these promiscuous, eleemosynary institutions.
It would be against all my principles to contribute
money to any such philanthropy. I
know too much about them&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t. He
could have disposed of his money to any one of
a dozen of these mid-Victorian charities, but
no&mdash;he was just one of those old parties that
want to shift their responsibilities on to young
shoulders, and so he chose mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak very kindly of your dear
dead relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel very kindly toward him. He
was a meddling old creature. He never gave
any member of the family a cent when they
wanted it and needed it. Now that I&rsquo;ve just
got my life in shape, and know what I want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' ></a>8</span>
do with it without being beholden to anybody
on earth, he leaves me a whole lot of superfluous
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t engaged to Caroline, who is a
jealous woman, though I say it as shouldn&rsquo;t,
I&rsquo;d be tempted to undertake the management of
your fortune myself,&rdquo; Billy said reflectively;
&ldquo;as it is&mdash;honor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I want to do with my life,&rdquo;
Nancy continued, as if he had not spoken. &ldquo;I
want to run an efficiency tea-room and serve
dinner and breakfast and tea to my fellow men
and women. I want the perfectly balanced ration,
perfectly served, to be my contribution to
the cause of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked about her ruefully. The sun,
through the barred dusty windows, struck in
long slant rays, athwart the confusion of the
cellar, illuminating piles upon piles of gay, blue
latticed chinaware,&mdash;cups set out methodically
in rows on the lids and bottoms of packing
boxes; assorted sizes of plates and saucers,
graded pyramidically, rising from the floor.
There were also individual copper casseroles
and serving dishes, and a heterogeneous assortment
of Japanese basketry tangled in excelsior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' ></a>9</span>
and tissue. A wandering sunbeam took her
hair, displaying its amber, translucent quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got capital enough to get it going
right; to swing it for the first year, even if I
don&rsquo;t make a cent on it. It&rsquo;s my one big chance
to do my share in the world, and to work out
my own salvation. This legacy is a menace to
all my dreams and plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; Billy said. &ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t see is
what you gain by refusing to let it catch up
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not it till you&rsquo;re tagged. That&rsquo;s all.
If I don&rsquo;t know whether my income is going to
be five thousand dollars or twenty-five thousand
a year, I can go on unpacking teacups with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand or twenty-five&mdash;my darling
Nancy! You&rsquo;ll have fifty thousand a year at
the very lowest estimate. The actual money is
more than five hundred thousand dollars. The
stock in the Union Rubber Company will
amount to as much again, maybe twice as much.
You&rsquo;re a real heiress, my dear, with wads of
real money to show for it. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m
trying to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand a year!&rdquo; Nancy turned a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' ></a>10</span>
shocked face, from which the color slowly
drained, leaving it blue-white. &ldquo;Fifty thousand
a year! You&rsquo;re mad. It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;um. Fifty thousand at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s pallor increased. She closed her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Billy said sharply. &ldquo;No
woman can faint on me just because she&rsquo;s had
money left her. You make me feel like the
ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy clutched at his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Billy!&rdquo; she besought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m past joking
now. Fifty thousand a year! Why, Uncle
Elijah bought fifteen-dollar suits and fifteen-cent
lunches. How could a retired sea captain
get all that money by investing in a little rubber,
and getting to be president of a little rubber
company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how. Be a good sensible girl, and
face the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to give up the tea-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy laid a consolatory arm over her shoulder,
and patted her awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s worse things in
this world than money. The time may come
when you&rsquo;ll be grateful to your poor little old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' ></a>11</span>
uncle, for his nifty little fifty thousand per
annum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy turned a tragic face to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m not grateful to him,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I doubt if I ever will be. I don&rsquo;t want the
stupid money. I want to work life out in my
own way. I know I&rsquo;ve got it in me, and I want
my chance to prove it. I want to give myself,
my own brain and strength, to the job I&rsquo;ve selected
as mine. Now, it&rsquo;s all spoiled for me.
I&rsquo;m subsidized. I&rsquo;m done for, and I can&rsquo;t see
any way out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can give the money away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. Giving money away is a special
science of itself. If I devote my life to doing
that as it should be done, I won&rsquo;t have time or
energy for anything else. I&rsquo;m not a philanthropist
in that sense. I wanted my restaurant to
be philanthropic only incidentally. I wanted
to cram my patrons with the full value of
their money&rsquo;s worth of good nourishing food;
to increase the efficiency of hundreds of
people who never suspected I was doing it, by
scientific methods of feeding. That&rsquo;s my dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good little dream, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make people eat the right food; to help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' ></a>12</span>
them to a fuller and more effective use of
themselves by supplying them with the proper
fuel for their functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could buy a chain of restaurants with
the money you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a chain of restaurants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can endow a perpetual diet squad.
You can buy out the whole Life Extension
Institute. If you would only stop to think of
the advantages of having all the money you
wanted to spend on anything you wanted,
you&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; Nancy said solemnly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
through all that. If I had thought I would
have been a better person with a great deal of
money at my disposal, I&mdash;I might have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married Dick,&rdquo; Billy finished for her. &ldquo;I
forgot that interesting possibility. I suppose
to a girl who has just turned down a cold five
millions, this meager little proposition&rdquo;&mdash;he
flourished the crumpled document in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;has
no real allure. Lord! What a world this
is. You&rsquo;ll marry Dick yet. Them as has&mdash;<i>gits</i>.
It never rains but it pours. To the victor
belong the spoils, <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money simply does not interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' ></a>13</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dick interests you. I don&rsquo;t know to what
extent, but he interests you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sentimental, Billy. Just because
you&rsquo;re in love with Caroline, you can&rsquo;t make
all your other friends marry each other. Tell
me what to do about this legacy. What is customary
when you get a lump of money like that?
I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to begin to get rid of all
<i>this</i> immediately.&rdquo; There was more than a
hint of tears in her voice, but she smiled at
Billy bravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so perfectly crazy about
these&mdash;these cups and saucers, Billy. See the
lovely way that rose is split to fit into the
design. Oh, when do I come into possession,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t come into possession right away,
you know. You don&rsquo;t inherit for a couple of
years, under the Rhode Island law. The formalities
will take&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy Boynton, do you mean to say that
I won&rsquo;t have to do a blessed thing about this
money for two years?&rdquo; Nancy shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. It takes a certain amount of red
tape to settle an estate, to probate a will, etc.,
and the law allows a period of time, varying
in different states&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' ></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! Is there anything in all this universe
so stupid as a man?&rdquo; Nancy interrupted fervently.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me that before?
Do you suppose I care how much money I have
two years from now? Two years of freedom,
why, that&rsquo;s all I want, Billy. There you&rsquo;ve
been sitting up winking and blinking at me
like a sympathetic old owl, when all I needed
to know was that I had two years of grace.
Of course, I&rsquo;ll go on with my tea-room, and
not a soul shall know the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the feminine temperament has my
hearty admiration and my most cordial endorsement,&rdquo;
Billy murmured, &ldquo;there are things
about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have to tell anybody, will I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law to that effect. If your
friends don&rsquo;t know it from you, they&rsquo;re not
likely to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I
only told you, because it seemed rather in your
line of work, and I was getting so much mail
about it, I thought it would be wise to have
some one look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up my law practice and Caroline
for three days in your service.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' ></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done more than well, Billy, and I&rsquo;m
grateful to you. Of course, you would have
saved me days of nervous wear and tear if it
had only occurred to you to tell me the one
simple little thing that was the essential point
of the whole matter. If I had known that I
didn&rsquo;t inherit for two years, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
cared <i>what</i> was in that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy stared at her feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A peculiar sensation always comes over
me,&rdquo; he said musingly, &ldquo;after I spend several
hours uninterruptedly in the society of a
woman who is using her mind in any way. I
couldn&rsquo;t explain it to you exactly. It&rsquo;s a kind
of impression that my own brain has begun to
disintegrate, and to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself, Billy.&rdquo;
Nancy soothed him sweetly,&mdash;Billy was not one
of the people to whom she habitually allowed
full conversational leeway: &ldquo;Swear you won&rsquo;t
tell Caroline or Betty&mdash;or Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy held out her hand to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I appreciate
you, which is more than Caroline does,
I&rsquo;m afraid. Run along and see her now&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' ></a>16</span>
don&rsquo;t need you any more, and you&rsquo;re probably
dying to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy bowed over her hand, lingeringly and
politely, but once releasing it, he shook his
big frame, and straightening up, drew a long
deep breath of something very like relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all deference to your delightful sex,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the only society that I&rsquo;m dying for at
the present moment is that of the old family
bar-keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Billy left her, Nancy turned to her basement
window, and stood looking out at the
quaint stone court he had to cross in order to
reach the high gate that guarded the entrance
to the marble worker&rsquo;s establishment, under
the shadow of which it was her intention to
open her out-of-door tea-room. She watched
him dreamily is he made his way among the
cinerary urns, the busts and statues and bas-reliefs
that were a part of the stock in trade
of her incongruous business associate.</p>
<p>In her investigation of the various sorts and
conditions of restaurants in New York, she
characteristically hit upon the garden restaurant,
a commonplace in the down-town table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te district, as the ideal setting for her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' ></a>17</span>
adventure in practical philanthropy, while the
ubiquitous tea-room and antique-shop combination
gave her the inspiration to stage her
own undertaking even more spectacularly.
Her enterprise was destined to flourish picturesquely
in the open court during the fair
months of the year, and in the winter months,
or in the event of a bad storm, to be housed
under the eaves in the rambling garret of the
old brick building, the lower floor of which
was given over to traffic in marbles.</p>
<p>She sighed happily. Billy, extricating himself
from the grasp of an outstretched marble
hand, which bad seemed to clutch desperately
at his elbow, and narrowly escaping a plunge
into a too convenient bird&rsquo;s bath, turned to see
her eyes following him, and waved gaily, but
she scarcely realized that he had done so. It
was rather with the eye of her mind that she
was contemplating the dark, quadrangular
area outstretched before her. In spirit she
was moving to and fro among the statuary,
bringing a housewifely order out of the chaos
that prevailed,&mdash;placing stone ladies draped in
stone or otherwise; cherubic babies, destined to
perpetual cold water bathing; strange mortuary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' ></a>18</span>
furniture, in the juxtaposition that would
make the most effective background for her
enterprise.</p>
<p>She saw the gritty, gray paving stones of
the court cleared of their litter, and scoured
free from discoloration and grime, set with
dozens of little tables immaculate in snowy
napery and shiny silver, and arranged with
careful irregularity at the most alluring angle.
She saw a staff of Hebe-like waitresses in blue
chambray and pink ribbons, to match the chinaware,
and all bearing a marked resemblance to
herself in her last flattering photograph, moving
among a crowd of well brought up but
palpably impoverished young people,&mdash;mostly
social workers and artists. They were <i>all</i>
young, and most of them very beautiful. In
all her twenty-five years, she had never before
been so close to a vision realized, as she was
at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside Inn,&rdquo; she said to herself, still smiling.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect name for it, really. Outside
Inn!&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Applicants for Blue Chambray</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Ann Martin was an orphan of New
England extraction. Her father, the
eldest child of a simple unpretentious country
family in Western Massachusetts, had been a
brilliant but erratic throw-back to Mayflower
traditions and Puritan intellectualism. He had
married a girl with much the same ancestry as
his own, but herself born and brought up in
New York, and of a generation to which the
assumption of prerogative was a natural
rather than an acquired characteristic. The
possession of a comfortable degree of fortune
and culture was a matter of course with Ann
Winslow, while to poor David Martin education
in the finer things of life, and the opportunity
to indulge his taste in the choice of surroundings
and associates, were hard-won privileges.</p>
<p>Both parents had been killed in a railroad
accident when Ann, or Nancy as her mother had
insisted on calling her from the day of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' ></a>20</span>
christening, was about seven years old. She
had been placed in the care of a maternal aunt,
and had flourished in the heart of a well
ordered establishment of the mid-Victorian
type, run by a vigorous, rather worldly old
lady.</p>
<p>From her lovely mother&mdash;Ann Winslow had
been more than a merely attractive or pretty
woman; she had the real grace and distinction,
and purity of profile that placed her in the
actual category of beauty,&mdash;Nancy had inherited
a healthy and equitable outlook on life,
while her father, irresistible and impracticable
being that he was, had endowed her with a
certain eccentric and adventurous spirit in the
investigation of it.</p>
<p>She had been educated in a boarding-school,
forty minutes&rsquo; run from New York, and had
specialized in the domestic sciences and basket
ball; and on attaining her majority had taken
up a course or two at Columbia, rather more
to put off the evil day of assuming the responsibility
of the stuffy, stately old house in Washington
Square than because she ever expected
to make any use of her superfluous education.
She was conceded by every one to be her aunt&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' ></a>21</span>
heir, but old Miss Winslow died intestate, very
suddenly in Nancy&rsquo;s twenty-third year; and the
beneficiaries of this accident, most of them extremely
well-to-do themselves, combined to
make Nancy a regular allowance until she was
twenty-five. On her twenty-fifth birthday fifteen
thousand dollars was deposited to her account
in the Trust Company which conserved
the family fortunes of the Winslows, and
Nancy understood that they considered their
duty by her to be done. It was with this fifteen
thousand dollars that she was to inaugurate
her darling enterprise,&mdash;Outside Inn.</p>
<p>Money, as she had truthfully told Billy,
meant nothing to her. Her aunt, living and
giving generously, had furnished her with a
background of comfortable, unostentatious well
being, against which the rather vivid elements
that went to make up her intimate social circle&mdash;she
was a creature of intimates&mdash;stood out
in alluring relief. She had literally never
wanted for anything. Her tastes, to be sure,
were modest, but the wherewithal to gratify
them had always been almost stultifyingly near
at hand. The excitement and adventure of an
income to which there was attached some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' ></a>22</span>
uncertainty had never been hers, and she was
too much her father&rsquo;s daughter to be interested
in the playing of any game in which she could
not lose. With all she possessed staked against
her untried business acumen she was for the
first time in her life concerned with her financial
situation, and quite honestly resentful of
any interruption of her experiment. Her life
was closely associated with her mother&rsquo;s family.
Her father&rsquo;s people had at no time entered
into her scheme of living,&mdash;her uncle Elijah
less than any member of it, and she found his
post-obit intervention in her affairs embarrassing
in a dozen different connections.</p>
<p>The best friend she had in the world, before
he had made the tactical error of asking her
to marry him, was Richard Thorndyke. He
was still, thanks to his immediate skill in trying
to retrieve that error, a very good friend
indeed. Nancy would normally have told him
everything that happened to her in the exact
order of its occurrence; but partly because she
did not wish to exaggerate her eccentricity in
eyes that looked upon her so kindly, and partly
because she had the instinct to spare him the
realization that there was no way in which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' ></a>23</span>
might come to her rescue in the event of disaster,&mdash;she
did not inform him of her legacy.
She knew that he was shrewdly calculating to
stand behind her venture, morally and practically,
and that the chief incentive of his
encouragement and helpfulness was the hidden
hope that through her experiment and its probable
unfortunate termination she would learn
to depend on <i>him</i>. Nancy was so sure of herself
that this attitude of Dick&rsquo;s roused her
tenderness instead of her ire.</p>
<p>The two girls who were closest to her, Caroline
Eustace and Betty Pope, had been actively
enlisted in the service of Outside Inn and the
ideals that it represented. Betty, a dimpling,
dynamic little being, who took a sporting interest
in any project that interested her, irrespective
of its merits, was to be associated with
Nancy in the actual management of the restaurant.
Caroline, who took herself more seriously,
and was busy with a dozen enterprises
that had to do with the welfare of the race, was
concerned chiefly with the humanitarian side
of the undertaking and willing to deflect to it
only such energy as she felt to be essential to
its scientific betterment. She was tentatively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' ></a>24</span>
engaged to Billy Boynton,&mdash;for what reason no
one&mdash;not even Billy&mdash;had been able to determine;
since she systematically disregarded him
in relation to all the interests and activities
that went to make up her life.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Inn progressed rapidly. It
was in the first week of May that Nancy and
Billy had their memorable discussion of her
situation. By the latter part of June, when she
could be reasonably sure of a succession of
propitious days and nights, for she had set her
heart on balmy weather conditions, Nancy
expected to have her formal opening,&mdash;a dinner
which not only initiated her establishment, but
submitted it to the approval of her own group
of intimate friends, who were to be her guests
on that occasion.</p>
<p>Meantime, the most extensive and discriminating
preparations were going forward. Billy
and Dick were present one afternoon by special
request when Betty and Nancy were interviewing
a contingent of waitresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got three perfectly charming girls
already,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;that is, girls that look
perfectly charming to me, but a man&rsquo;s point
of view on a woman&rsquo;s looks is so different that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' ></a>25</span>
I thought it would be a good plan to have you
boys look over this lot. They are all very
high-class and competent girls. The Manning
Agency doesn&rsquo;t send any other kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trot &rsquo;em along,&rdquo; Billy said; &ldquo;where are they
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the room in front.&rdquo; They were in the
smallest of the nest of attic rooms that Nancy
planned to make her winter quarters. &ldquo;Michael
receives them, and shows them in here one by
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like Michael then?&rdquo; Dick asked. &ldquo;I
always said his talents were hidden at our
place. He has a soul above the job of handy
man on a Long Island farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s certainly a handy man here,&rdquo; Nancy
said; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lucky dog,&rdquo; Billy said, with a side
glance at Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Betty explained, &ldquo;the girl comes
in, and we ask her questions. Then if I don&rsquo;t
like her I take my pencil from behind my ear,
and rap against my palm with it. If Nancy
doesn&rsquo;t like her she says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re losing a hairpin,
Betty.&rsquo; If we like her we rub our hands
together.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' ></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good system,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
see why Nancy doesn&rsquo;t take her pencil from
behind her ear, or why you don&rsquo;t say to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put a pencil behind my ear,&rdquo;
Nancy said scathingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she never loses a hairpin,&rdquo; Betty cut
in. &ldquo;If I approve this system of signals I don&rsquo;t
see what you have to complain of. Nancy
couldn&rsquo;t get a pencil behind her ear even if
she wanted to. It&rsquo;s only a criminal ear like
mine that accommodates a pencil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of ears,&rdquo; Dick said, looking at
his watch, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get on with the beauty show.
I have to take my mother to see <i>Boris</i> to-night,
and she has an odd notion of being on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw right,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Michael.
Bring in the first one immediately, Michael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I will that, Miss Pope.&rdquo; The old
family servitor of the Thorndykes pulled a
deliberate lid over a twinkling left eye by way
of acknowledging the presence of his young
master. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s quite a display of thim this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first applicant, guided thus by Michael,
appeared on the threshold and stood for a
moment framed in the low doorway. Seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' ></a>27</span>
two gentlemen present she carefully arranged
her expression to meet that contingency. She
was a blonde girl with masses of doubtfully
tinted hair and no chin, but her eyes were
very blue and matched a chain of turquoise
beads about her throat, and she radiated a
peculiar vitality.</p>
<p>Betty took her pencil from behind her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing a hair&mdash;&rdquo; Nancy began, but
Dick and Billy exchanged glances and began
rubbing their hands together energetically and
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Nancy said crisply, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re
a little too tall for our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And too blonde,&rdquo; Betty added with a bland
dismissing smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a special
type of girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood you were looking for a waitress,&rdquo;
the girl said pertly, with her eyes on
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Billy answered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not now.
My&mdash;my wife won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo; He waved an
inclusive hand in the direction of Nancy and
Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t behave,&rdquo; Nancy said, while they
waited for Michael to bring in the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' ></a>28</span>
girl, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stay. If that is the kind of
girl you men find attractive then my restaurant
is doomed from the beginning. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have that girl in my employ for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could begin again, applicant number
two stood before them,&mdash;a comfortable,
kind-eyed girl, no longer very young but with
efficiency written all over her, despite the shyness
that beset her.</p>
<p>Nancy rubbed her hands with satisfaction
and looked at Betty, who beamed back at her.
The girl, encouraged by Nancy&rsquo;s kindly smile
took a step forward, and began to recite her
qualifications for the position. Dick fumbled
with a fountain-pen which he placed elaborately
behind his ear for an instant, and then
as ostentatiously removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re losing a hairpin, Dick,&rdquo;
Billy suggested solicitously, as Nancy, ignoring
their existence entirely, proceeded to make
terms with the newcomer.</p>
<p>The next girl created a diversion&mdash;being
palpably an adventuress out of a job and
impressing none of the quartette as being interesting
enough to deserve one,&mdash;but the two girls
who followed her were bright and sprightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' ></a>29</span>
creatures, disarmingly graceful and ingenuous,
of whom the entire quartette approved.
They were twin sisters, they said, Dolly and
Molly, and they had always had places together
ever since they had begun working out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, pretty maiden, <i>are</i> there any more
at home <i>like</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Billy was addressing Molly
gravely when Dick slipped a friendly but firm
hand over his jugular region, and cut off his
utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not feeling quite himself,&rdquo; he explained
suavely to Dolly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll bring him around
soon.&mdash;I think you&rsquo;ll find Miss Martin an ideal
person to work for, and the salary and the
hours unusually satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Molly and Dolly
together, in the English manner which showed
the excellence of their training.</p>
<p>There were several other dubby creatures so
much out of the picture that they were not
even considered, and then Michael brought in
what he called &ldquo;a grand girl,&rdquo; and left her
standing statuesquely in their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With large lovely arms and a neck like a
tower,&rdquo; Dick quoted in his throat.</p>
<p>Nancy engaged her without enthusiasm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' ></a>30</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll draw,&rdquo; she said briefly. &ldquo;Personally,
I dislike these Alma Tadema girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the men see,&rdquo; Betty said, curling
around the better part of two straight dining
chairs, in the moment of relaxation that followed
the final disposition of the business of
the day, &ldquo;in a girl like that first one is one of
the mysteries of existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Nancy agreed, with New England
colloquialism. &ldquo;You feel reasonably allied
to them as a sex, and then suddenly they show
some vulgar preference for a woman like that,
and it&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This from the woman who thinks my chauffeur
is an ideal of manly beauty,&rdquo; Dick scoffed,
&ldquo;a dimpled man with a little finger ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can run a car, though,&rdquo; Nancy retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet little blue eyes could run a restaurant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just the trouble,&mdash;she would have
been running mine in twenty-four hours. Oh!
I think what you men really like is a bossy
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what a woman really likes in a man&mdash;&rdquo;
Betty began, &ldquo;is&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quality,&rdquo; Nancy finished for her succinctly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' ></a>31</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; Dick mused. &ldquo;I should have
said finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost any kind of finish so long as it is
smooth enough,&rdquo; Billy supplemented. &ldquo;Look at
the way they eat up this artistic and poetic
veneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the way they mangle their metaphors,&rdquo;
Nancy complained to Betty.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;I know what I really like in a woman,&rdquo; Dick
whispered to Nancy, as he helped her into her
coat just before they started out together, &ldquo;and
you know what I like, too. That&rsquo;s one of the
subjects that needs no discussion between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty and Billy walking up the avenue ahead
of them,&mdash;Outside Inn was located in one of
the cross-streets in the thirties,&mdash;were discussing
their relation to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder sometimes if Nancy&rsquo;s got it in her
really to care for a man,&rdquo; Betty argued; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
as fond as she can be of Dick, but she&rsquo;d sacrifice
him heart, soul and body for that restaurant
of hers. She&rsquo;s a perfect darling, I don&rsquo;t
mean that; she&rsquo;s the very essence of sweetness
and kindness, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to
understand or appreciate the possibilities of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' ></a>32</span>
devotion like Dick&rsquo;s. Do you think she&rsquo;s really
capable of loving anybody&mdash;of putting any man
in the world before all her ideas and notions
and experiments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, yes,&rdquo; said Billy, accelerating his pace,
suggestively in the hope of getting Betty home
in good time for him to dress to keep his
engagement with Caroline.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_III_INAUGURATION'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Inauguration</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nancy&rsquo;s heart was beating heavily when
she woke on the memorable morning of
the day that was to inaugurate the activities of
Outside Inn. A confused dream of her Uncle
Elijah in tatters on a park bench, which was
instantly metamorphosed into one of the rustic
seats she had arranged against the wall along
the side of some of the bigger tables in the
marble worker&rsquo;s court, was ostensibly the cause
of the disturbance in her cardiac region. She
had, it seemed, in the interminable tangle of
nightmare, given Molly and Dolly and the
Alma Tadema girl instructions to throw out
the unwelcome guest, and she was standing by
with Michael, who was assuring her that the
big blonde was &ldquo;certain a grand bouncer,&rdquo; when
she was smitten with a sickening dream-panic
at her own ingratitude. &ldquo;He has given me
everything he had in the world, poor old man,&rdquo;
she said to herself, and approached him remorsefully;
but when she looked at him again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' ></a>34</span>
she saw that he had the face and figure of a
young stranger, and that the garments that had
seemed to her to be streaming and unsightly
rags, were merely the picturesque habiliments
of a young artist, apparently newly translated
from the Boulevard Montparnasse. At the
sight of the stranger a heart-sinking terror
seemed to take possession of her, and so, quaking
and quavering in mortal intimidation,&mdash;she
woke up.</p>
<p>She laughed at herself as she brushed the
sleep out of her eyes, and drew the gradual
long breaths that soothed the physical agitation
that still beset her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as excited and
nervous as a youngster on circus day.&mdash;Oh! I&rsquo;m
glad the sun shines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy lived in a little apartment of her own
in that hinterland of what is now down-town
New York, between the Rialto and its more conventional
prototype, Society,&mdash;that is, she lived
east of Broadway on a cross-street in the
forties. The maid who took care of her had
been in her aunt&rsquo;s employ for years, and had
seen Nancy grow from her rather spoiled babyhood
to a hoydenish childhood, and so on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' ></a>35</span>
soft-eyed, vibrant maturity. She was the only
person who tyrannized over Nancy. She
brought her a cup of steaming hot water with
a pinch of soda in it, now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were moaning and groaning in your
sleep,&rdquo; she said, in the strident accents of her
New England birthplace, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ll have to
drink this before I give you a living thing for
your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Hitty,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;and thank you
kindly. Now I know you&rsquo;ve been making pop-overs,
and are afraid they will disagree with
me. I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;for I need the moral effect of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno whether pop-overs is so moral, or
so immoral if it comes to that. I notice it&rsquo;s
always the folks that ain&rsquo;t had much to do with
morals one way or the other that&rsquo;s so almighty
glib about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal in what you say, Hitty.
If I had time I would go into the matter with
you, but this is my busy day.&rdquo; Nancy sat up
in bed, and began sipping her hot water obediently.
She looked very childlike in her
straight cut, embroidered night-gown, with a
long chestnut pig-tail over either shoulder. &ldquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' ></a>36</span>
feel as if I were going to be married, or&mdash;or
something. I&rsquo;m so excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d be a good sight more excited
if you was going to be married&rdquo;&mdash;Hitty was
a widow of twenty-five years&rsquo; standing&mdash;&ldquo;and
according to my way of thinking &rsquo;twould be
a good deal more suitable,&rdquo; she added darkly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take much stock in this hotel business.
In my day there warn&rsquo;t no such newfangled
foolishness for a girl to take up with instead
o&rsquo; getting married and settled down. When I
was your age I was working on my second set
o&rsquo; baby clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold, Hitty,&rdquo; Nancy coaxed. &ldquo;I could
make perfectly good baby clothes if I needed
to. Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ll be of more use in the
world serving nourishing food to hordes of
hungry men and women than making baby
clothes for one hypothetical baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno about the hypothetical part,&rdquo; Hitty
said, folding back the counterpane, inexorably.
&ldquo;What I do know is that a girl that&rsquo;s getting to
be an old girl&mdash;like you&mdash;past twenty-five&mdash;ought
to be bestirring herself to look for a life
pardner if she don&rsquo;t see any hanging around
that suits her, instead of opening up a hotel for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' ></a>37</span>
a passel of perfect strangers. If ever I saw a
woman spoiling for something of her own to
fuss over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever there was a woman who <i>had</i> something
of her own to fuss over,&rdquo; Nancy cried
ecstatically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that woman to-day, Hitty.
You&rsquo;re a professional Puritan, and you don&rsquo;t
understand the broader aspects of the maternal
instinct.&rdquo; She sprang out of bed, and tucked
her bare pink toes into the fur bordered blue
mules that peeped from under the bed, and
slipped into the wadded blue silk bathrobe that
lay on the chair beside her. &ldquo;Is my bath drawn,
Hitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bath is drawed,&rdquo; Hitty acknowledged
sourly, &ldquo;and your breakfast will be on the table
in half an hour by the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must require that corrective
New England influence,&rdquo; Nancy said to herself,
as she tried the temperature of her bath and
found it frigid, &ldquo;just as some people need
acid in their diet. If my mother were alive, I
wonder what she would have said to me this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy spent a long day directing, planning,
and arranging for the great event of the evening,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' ></a>38</span>
the first dinner served to the public at
Outside Inn.</p>
<p>From the basement kitchen to the ground-floor
serving-room in the rear, space cunningly
coaxed from the reluctant marble worker, the
mechanism of Nancy&rsquo;s equipment was as perfect
as lavish expenditure and scientific management
could make it. The kitchen gleamed with
copper and granite ware; huge pots for soup
and vegetables, mammoth double boilers of
white enamel,&mdash;Nancy was firm in her conviction
that rice and cereal could be cooked in
nothing but white enamel,&mdash;rows upon rows of
shelves methodically set with containers and
casseroles and odd-shaped metal serving-dishes,
as well as the ubiquitous blue and rose-color
chinaware presenting its gay surface from
every available bit of space.</p>
<p>Presiding over the hooded ranges, two of gas
and one coal for toasting and broiling, there
was to be a huge Franco-American man-cook,
discovered in one of the Fifth Avenue pastry
shops in the course of Nancy&rsquo;s indefatigable
tours of exploration, who was the son of a
French <i>chef</i> and a Virginian mother, and could
express himself in the culinary art of either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' ></a>39</span>
his father&rsquo;s or his mother&rsquo;s nativity. His staff
of helpers and dishwashers had been chosen by
himself, with what Nancy considered most
felicitous results, while her own galaxy of waitresses,
who operated the service kitchen up-stairs,
proved themselves to a woman almost
unbelievably superior and efficient.</p>
<p>The courtyard itself was a brave spectacle in
its final aspect of background for the detail
and paraphernalia of polite dining. The more
unself-conscious of the statues, the nymphs and
nereids and Venuses, she managed either to
relegate to the storehouse within, or to add a
few cunningly draped vines to the nonchalance
of their effect, while the gargoyles and Roman
columns and some of the least ambitious of the
fountain-models she was able to adapt delightfully
to her outrageous ideal of arrangement.
Dick had denuded several smart florist shops
to furnish her with field flowers enough to
develop her decorative scheme, which included
strangely the stringing of half a dozen huge
Chinese lanterns that even in the daylight took
on a meteoric light and glow.</p>
<p>The night was clear and soft, and Fifth
Avenue, ingratiatingly swept and garnished,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' ></a>40</span>
stretched its wake of summer allure before the
never unappreciative eyes of Billy and Caroline,
and Betty and Dick respectively, who had met
at the Waldorf by appointment, and were now
making their way, thus ceremoniously and in
company, to the formal opening dinner of
Nancy&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>Two nondescript Pagan gentlemen of Titanesque
proportions had joined the watch of the
conventional leonine twins, and the big gate
now stood hospitably open, over it swinging
the new sign in gallant crimson and white,
that announced to all the world that Outside
Inn was even at that moment, at its most punctilious
service.</p>
<p>Molly and Dolly, in the prescribed blue
chambray, their cheeks several shades pinker
than their embellishment of pink ribbon, and
panting with ill-suppressed excitement, rushed
forward to greet the four and ushered them
solemnly to their places,&mdash;the gala table in the
center of the court, set with a profusion of
fleur de lis, with pink ribbon trainers.
Thanks to Dick&rsquo;s carefully manipulated advertising
campaign and personal efforts among
his friends and business associates, they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' ></a>41</span>
not by any means the first arrivals. Half a
dozen laughing groups were distributed about
the round tables in the center space, while
several t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te couples were confidentially
ensconced in corners and at cozy tables for
two, craftily sheltered by some of the most
imposing of the marble figures and columns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like a real restaurant,&rdquo; Caroline
said wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think it would seem like?&rdquo;
Betty asked argumentatively. &ldquo;Just because
Nancy is the best friend you have in the world,
and you&rsquo;re familiar with her in pig-tails and a
dressing-gown doesn&rsquo;t argue that she is incapable
of managing an undertaking like this as
well as if she were a perfect stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it does,&rdquo; Caroline mused,
&ldquo;but someway I&rsquo;d feel easier about a perfect
stranger investing her last cent in such a venture.
I don&rsquo;t see how she can possibly make
it pay, and I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could ever have
a comfortable moment again until I knew
whether she could or not.&mdash;What are you looking
so guilty about, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was regretting your uncomfortable moments,
Caroline,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;and wishing it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' ></a>42</span>
were in my power to do away with them, but
it isn&rsquo;t. I was also musing sadly, but quite
irrelevantly, on the tangled web we weave when
first we practise to deceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you deceiving Caroline in some way?&rdquo;
Dick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Caroline answered for him,
&ldquo;though he has full permission to if he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time may come when he will avail
himself of that permission,&rdquo; Betty said; &ldquo;you
ought to be careful how you tempt Fate, Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to be,&rdquo; Billy groaned, &ldquo;but the
fact is that I am not one of the things she is
superstitious about. Pipe the dame at the
corner table with the lorgnette. Classy, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of my aunt&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Dick said, acknowledging
the lady&rsquo;s salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Belasco adventuress in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stenographer,&rdquo; Dick explained, bowing
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of men coming,&rdquo; Billy
said; &ldquo;if they put the place on the bum you&rsquo;ve
got to help me bounce them, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up-stairs in the service kitchen,&rdquo; Betty was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' ></a>43</span>
explaining to Caroline, &ldquo;they keep all the dishes
that don&rsquo;t have to be heated for serving, also
the silver and daily linen supply. When we
seat ourselves at a table like this, the waitress
to whom it is assigned goes in and gets a
basket of bread&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s a pretty idea to
serve the bread in baskets, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and
whatever silver is necessary, and a bottle of
water. When she places those things she asks
us what our choice of a meat course is,&mdash;there
is a choice except on chicken night&mdash;and gives
that order in the kitchen when she goes to get
our soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who serves the things,&mdash;puts the meat on
the plates, and dishes up the vegetables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook&mdash;Nancy won&rsquo;t let me call him the
<i>chef</i>&mdash;because she is going to make a specialty
of the southern element of his education. He
has a serving-table by his range and he cuts
up the meat and fowl, and dishes up the vegetables.
In a bigger establishment he would
have a helper to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t Michael help him?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael calls him the Haythan Shinee. He
is rather a <i>glossy</i> man, you know, and he says
when the time comes for him, Michael, to dress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' ></a>44</span>
like a street cleaner and pilot a gravy boat,
he&rsquo;ll let us know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respect for his superiors is not one of Michael&rsquo;s
most salient characteristics,&rdquo; Dick twinkled.
&ldquo;Nancy and I have a scheme for making
a match between him and Hitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the soup,&rdquo; Betty announced.
&ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s idea is to have everything perfectly
simple, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply perfect,&rdquo; Billy assisted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she going to eat with us?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s busy getting it going just
at present. She may appear later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s got to direct this pageant, old
top,&rdquo; Billy reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soup is perfect,&rdquo; Caroline said seriously.
&ldquo;It is simple&mdash;with that deceptive simplicity of
a Paris morning frock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French home cooking is all like that,&rdquo; Dick
said. &ldquo;I like pur&eacute;e of forget-me-nots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly or Dolly, I can&rsquo;t tell the difference between
you,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;extend our compliments
to Miss Martin, and tell her that this course is
a triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see the roast, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very <i>best</i> sirloin,&rdquo; Dick announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' ></a>45</span>
at the first mouthful, &ldquo;and these assorted vegetables
all cut down to the same size are as pretty
as they are good, as one says of virtuous innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This variety of asparagus is expensive,&rdquo;
Caroline said; &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t do things like this at
seventy-five cents a head. She&rsquo;ll ruin herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how she can,&rdquo; Dick said thoughtfully,
&ldquo;with the price of foodstuffs soaring sky-high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never for a moment expected it to pay,&rdquo;
Betty said, &ldquo;but think of the run she will have
for her money, and the experience we&rsquo;ll get out
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in it for the romance there is in it,
Betty. I must confess it isn&rsquo;t altogether my
idea of a good time,&rdquo; Caroline said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, you would go in for military training
for women, and that sort of thing. There&rsquo;s
a woman over there asking for more olives, and
she&rsquo;s eaten a plate full of them already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re as big as hen&rsquo;s eggs anyhow,&rdquo; Caroline
groaned, &ldquo;and almost as extravagant. I
don&rsquo;t see how Nancy&rsquo;ll go through the first
month at this rate. There she comes now.
Doesn&rsquo;t she look nice in that color of green?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' ></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like my party?&rdquo; Nancy asked,
slipping into the empty chair between Dick and
Billy; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t the food good and nourishing, and
aren&rsquo;t there a lot of nice-looking people here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much, and it is, and there are,&rdquo; Dick
answered with affectionate eyes on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The salad is alligator pear served in half
sections, with French dressing,&rdquo; she said
dreamily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too happy to eat, but I&rsquo;ll have
some with you. Look at them all, don&rsquo;t they
look relaxed and soothed and refreshed? Every
individual has a perfectly balanced ration of
the most superlatively good quality, slowly beginning
to assimilate within him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see many respectable working girls,&rdquo;
Billy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are though,&mdash;from the different shops
and offices on the avenue. There is a contingent
from the Columbia summer school coming to-morrow
evening. This group coming in now
is newspaper people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the fellow sitting over in the corner
with that Vie de Boh&ecirc;me hat? He looks familiar,
but I can&rsquo;t seem to place him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in black with the mustache?&rdquo; Dick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' ></a>47</span>
asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an artist, pretty well known.
That impressionistic chap&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think of his
name&mdash;that had that exhibition at the Palsifer
galleries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he sell?&rdquo; Caroline asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they say he&rsquo;s awfully poor, refuses to
paint down to the public taste. What the deuce
is his name&mdash;oh! I know, Collier Pratt&mdash;do
you know him, Nancy? Lived in Paris always
till the war. He&rsquo;ll appreciate Ritz cooking at
Riggs&rsquo; prices if anybody will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy looked fixedly at the small side-table
where the stranger had just placed himself as
if he were etched upon the whiteness of the wall
behind him. He sat erect and brooding,&mdash;his
dark, rather melancholy eyes staring straight
ahead, and a slight frown wrinkling his really
fine forehead. He wore an Inverness cape slung
over one shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like one of Rembrandt&rsquo;s portraits of
himself,&rdquo; Caroline suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a brigand,&rdquo; Betty said.
&ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s struck dumb with the privilege of
adding fuel to a flame of genius like that. Wake
up and eat your peach Melba, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' ></a>48</span></div>
<p>Nancy started, and took perfunctorily the
spoon that Molly was holding out to her, which
she forgot to lift to her lips even after it was
freighted with its first delicious mouthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed about that man,&rdquo; she said.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_IV_CINDERELLA'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Cinderella</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nancy shut the door of her apartment behind
her, and slipped out into the dimly
lit corridor. From her sitting-room came a
burst of concerted laughter, the sound of
Betty&rsquo;s sweet, high pitched voice raised in sudden
protest, and then the echo of some sort of
a physical struggle; and Caroline took the piano
and began to improvise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t miss me,&rdquo; Nancy said to herself,
&ldquo;I must have air.&rdquo; She drew a long breath
with a hand against her breast, apparently to
relieve the pressure there. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay shut
up in a <i>room</i>,&rdquo; she kept repeating as if she were
stating the most reasonable of premises, and
turning, fled down the two flights of stairs that
led to the outside door of the building.</p>
<p>The breath of the night was refreshingly cool
upon her hot cheeks, and she smiled into the
darkness gratefully. Across the way a row of
brownstone houses, implacably boarded up for
the summer, presented dull and dimly defined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' ></a>50</span>
surfaces that reflected nothing, not even the
lights of the street, or the shadow of a passing
straggler. Nancy turned her face toward the
avenue. The nostalgia that was her inheritance
from her father, and through him from a long
line of ancestors that followed the sea whither
it might lead them, was upon her this night, although
she did not understand it as such. She
only thought vaguely of a strip of white beach
with a whiter moon hung high above it, and the
long silver line of the tide,&mdash;drawing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a hat on,&rdquo; she said. There was
a night light in the chemist&rsquo;s shop at the corner,
and the panel of mirror obligingly placed
for the convenience of the passing crowd, at the
left of the big window, showed her reflection
quite plainly. She was suddenly inspired to
take the soft taffeta girdle from the waist of
her dark blue muslin gown, and bind it turban-wise
about her head. The effect was pleasingly
modish and conventional, and she quickened her
steps&mdash;satisfied. There was a tingle in the air
that set her blood pleasantly in motion, and
she established a rhythm of pace that made her
feel almost as if she were walking to music.
Insensibly her mind took up its responsibilities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' ></a>51</span>
again as the blood, stimulated from its temporary
inactivity, began to course naturally
through her veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is plenty of beer and ginger ale in
the ice-box,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve done this
before, so they won&rsquo;t be unnaturally disturbed
about me. Billy wanted to take Caroline home
early, and Dick can go on up-town with Betty,
without making her feel that she ought to leave
him alone with me for a last t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. It will
hurt Dick&rsquo;s feelings, but he understands really.
He has a most blessed understandingness, Dick
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had the avenue almost entirely to herself,
a silent gleaming thoroughfare with the
gracious emptiness that a much lived in street
sometimes acquires, of a Sunday at the end of
an adventurous season. It was early July, the
beginning of the actual summer season in New
York. Nancy had never before been in town so
late in the year, nor for that matter had Caroline
or Betty, but Betty&rsquo;s interest in the affairs
of the Inn was keeping her at Nancy&rsquo;s side,
while Caroline had just accepted a secretarial
position in one of the big Industrial Leagues
recently organized by women for women, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' ></a>52</span>
would keep her in town all summer. Billy and
Dick, by virtue of their respective occupations,
were never away from New York for longer
than the customary two weeks&rsquo; vacation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul smoothed itself out, a long cramped
scroll,&rdquo;&mdash;her conscience placated on the score of
her deserted guests, Nancy was quoting Browning
to herself, as she widened the distance between
herself and them. &ldquo;I wonder why I
have this irresistible tendency to shake the people
I love best in the world at intervals. I am
such a really well-balanced and rational individual,
I don&rsquo;t understand it in myself. I
thought the Inn was going to take all the nonsense
out of me, but it hasn&rsquo;t, it appears,&rdquo; she
sighed; &ldquo;but then, I think it is going to take the
nonsense out of a lot of people that are only
erratic because they have never been properly
fed. I guess I&rsquo;ll go and have a look at the old
place in its Sunday evening calm. Already it
seems queer not to be there at nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening, but I don&rsquo;t really think there are
people enough in New York now on Sundays to
make it an object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s feet turned mechanically toward the
arena of her most serious activities. Like most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' ></a>53</span>
of us who run away, she was following by instinct
the logical periphery of her responsibilities.</p>
<p>The big green latticed gate was closed against
all intruders. Nancy had the key to its padlock
in her hand-bag, but she had no intention of
using it. The white and crimson sign flapped
in the soft breeze companionably responsive to
the modest announcement, &ldquo;Marble Workshop,
Reproductions and Antiques, Garden Furniture,&rdquo;
which so inadequately invited those
whom it might concern to a view of the petrified
vaudeville within. Through the interstices
of the gate the courtyard looked littered and
unalluring;&mdash;the wicker tables without their
fine white covers; the chairs pushed back in a
heterogeneous assemblage; the segregated columns
of a garden peristyle gaunt against the
dark, gleamed a more ghostly white than the
weather-stained busts and figures less recently
added to the collection. It seemed to Nancy
incredible that the place would ever bloom again
with lights and bouquets and eager patrons,
with her group of pretty flower-like waitresses
moving deftly among them. She stared at the
spot with the cold eye of the creator whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' ></a>54</span>
handiwork is out of the range of his vision, and
the inspiration of it for the moment, gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like Cinderella and her godmother
rolled into one,&rdquo; she thought disconsolately. &ldquo;I
waved my wand, and made so many things
happen, and now that the clock has struck,
again here I am outside in the cold and dark,&rdquo;&mdash;the
wind was taking on a keener edge, and
she shivered slightly in her muslins&mdash;&ldquo;with
nothing but a pumpkin shell to show for it.
Hitty says that getting what you want is apt
to be unlikely business, and I&rsquo;m inclined to
think she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to her suddenly that the thing she
had wanted,&mdash;a picturesque, cleverly executed
restaurant where people could be fed according
to the academic ideals of an untried young
woman like herself was an unthinkable thing.
The power of illusion failed for the moment.
Just what was it that she had hoped to accomplish
with this fling at executive altruism?
What was she doing with a French cook in
white uniform, a competent staff of professional
dishwashers and waitresses and kitchen
helpers? How had it come about that she
owned so many mounds and heaps and pyramids
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' ></a>55</span>
of silver and metal and linen? What was
this Inn that she had conceived as a project so
unimaginably fine? Who were these shadow
people that came and went there? Who was
she? Why with all her vitality and all her
hungry yearning for life and adventure
couldn&rsquo;t she even believe in her own substantiality
and focus? Wasn&rsquo;t life even real enough
for a creature such as she to grasp it,&mdash;if it
wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;</p>
<p>She saw a figure that was familiar to her
turn in from the avenue, a tall man in an Inverness
with a wide black hat pulled down
over his eyes. For the moment she could not
remember who he was, but by the time he had
stopped in front of the big gate, giving utterance
to a well delivered expletive, she knew
him perfectly, and stood waiting, motionless,
for him to turn and speak to her. She was sure
that he would have no recollection of her. He
turned, but it was some seconds before he addressed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubt thou the stars are fire,&rdquo; he said at
last, with a shrug that admitted her to the companionship
of his discomfiture. &ldquo;Doubt thou
the sun doth move, doubt truth to be a liar, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' ></a>56</span>
never doubt that your favorite New York restaurant
will be closed on a Sunday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>is</i> it your favorite New York restaurant?&rdquo;
Nancy cried, her heart in her throat.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine, you know, my&mdash;my favorite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I judged, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be beating
against the gate so disconsolately.&rdquo; It was too
dark to see his face clearly, but Nancy realized
that he was looking down at her quizzically
through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really like this restaurant?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways I like it very much. The food
is quite possible as you know, very American in
character, but very good American, and it has
the advantage of being served out-of-doors. I
am a Frenchman by adoption, and I like the
outdoor caf&eacute;. In fact, I am never happy eating
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surroundings are picturesque?&rdquo; Nancy
hazarded.</p>
<p>The stranger laughed. &ldquo;According to the
American ideal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are&mdash;but I do
admit that they show a rather extraordinary
imagination. I&rsquo;ve often thought that I should
like to make the acquaintance of the woman,&mdash;of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' ></a>57</span>
course, it&rsquo;s a woman&mdash;who conceived the notion
of this mortuary tea-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, is it a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man wouldn&rsquo;t set up housekeeping in&mdash;in
<i>P&egrave;re Lachaise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, if he found a really domestic-looking
corner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> in the first place, it wouldn&rsquo;t
occur to him, that&rsquo;s all, and if he did he couldn&rsquo;t
get away with it. The only real drawback to
this hostelry is, as you know, that they don&rsquo;t
serve spirits of any kind. I&rsquo;m accustomed to a
glass or two of wine with my dinner, and my
food sticks in my throat when I can&rsquo;t have it,
but I&rsquo;ve found a way around that, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you?&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me away, but there&rsquo;s a man
about the place here whose name is Michael,
and he possesses that blend of Gallic facility
with Celtic canniness that makes the Irish so
wonderful as a race. I told my trouble to Michael,&mdash;with
the result that I get a teapot full
of Chianti with my dinner every night, and no
questions asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you do?&rdquo; gasped Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see Michael is serving the best interests
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' ></a>58</span>
of his employer, who wants to keep her patrons,
because if I couldn&rsquo;t have it I wouldn&rsquo;t be there.
He couldn&rsquo;t trouble the lady about it, naturally,
because it is technically an offense against the
law. Come, let&rsquo;s go and find a quiet corner
where we can continue our conversation comfortably.
There&rsquo;s a painfully respectable little
hotel around the corner here that looks like the
Caf&eacute; L&rsquo;avenue when you first go in, but is a
place where the most bourgeoise of one&rsquo;s aunts
might put up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that I can go,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t, you
know. My name is Collier Pratt. I&rsquo;m an artist.
The more bourgeoise of my aunts would introduce
me if she were here. She&rsquo;s a New Englander
like so many of your own charming relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; Nancy asked, as
she followed him with a docility quite new to
her, past the big green gate, and the row of
nondescript shops between it and the corner
of Broadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was <i>born</i> in Boston,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said a
trifle absently. &ldquo;I know a Massachusetts product
when I see one. Ah! here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' ></a>59</span></div>
<p>He led her triumphantly to a table in the far
corner of the practically empty restaurant,
waved away the civilities of a swarthy and
somewhat badly coordinated waiter, and pulled
out her chair for her himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let me have a look at you,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;why, you&rsquo;ve nothing on but muslin, and you&rsquo;re
wearing your belt for a turban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sop to the conventions,&rdquo; Nancy said,
blushing burningly. She was not quite able yet
to get her bearings with this extraordinary
man, who had assumed charge of her so cavalierly,
but she was eager to find her poise in
the situation. &ldquo;I ran away, and I thought it
would look better to have something like a
hat on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks,&rdquo; said Collier Pratt, &ldquo;looks! That&rsquo;s
New England, always the looks of a thing, never
the feel of it. Mind you I don&rsquo;t mean the <i>look</i>
of a thing, that&rsquo;s something different again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, the conventional slant as opposed
to the artistic perspective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! It isn&rsquo;t necessary to have my remarks
followed intelligently, but it always adds
piquancy to the situation when they are.
Speaking of artistic perspective, you have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' ></a>60</span>
very nice coloring. I like a ruddy chestnut hair
with a skin as delicately white and pink as
yours.&rdquo; He spoke impersonally with the narrowing
eye of the artist. &ldquo;I can see you either
in white,&mdash;not quite a cream white, but almost,&mdash;against
a pearly kind of Quakerish background,
or flaming out in the most crude,
barbaric assemblage of colors. That&rsquo;s the advantage
of your type and the environment you
connote&mdash;you can be the whole show, or the
veriest little mouse that ever sought the protective
coloring of the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t exactly taking the quickest way
of putting me at my ease,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
very much embarrassed, you know. I&rsquo;d stand
being looked over for a few minutes longer if
I could,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not having one of my
most equable evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said.</p>
<p>For the first time since she had seen his face
with the light upon it, he smiled, and the smile
relieved the rather empiric quality of his habitual
expression. Nancy noticed the straight
line of the heavy brows scarcely interrupted by
the indication of the beginning of the nose, and
wondering to herself if it were not possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' ></a>61</span>
for a person with that eyebrow formation to
escape the venality of disposition that is popularly
supposed to be its adjunct,&mdash;decided affirmatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to talking to American girls
very much. I forget how daintily they&rsquo;re accustomed
to being handled. I&rsquo;m extremely anxious
to put you at your ease,&rdquo; he added quietly.
&ldquo;I appreciate the privilege of your company on
what promised to be the dullest of dull evenings.
I should appreciate still more,&rdquo; he bowed,
as he handed her a bill of fare of the journalistic
proportions of the usual hotel menu,
&ldquo;if you would make a choice of refreshment,
that we may dispense with the somewhat pathological
presence of our young friend here,&rdquo; he
indicated the waiter afflicted with the jerking
and titubation of a badly strung puppet. &ldquo;I advise
Rhine wine and seltzer. I offer you anything
from green chartreuse to Scotch and soda.
Personally I&rsquo;m going to drink Perrier water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have an ice-cream,&rdquo; Nancy said,
&ldquo;than anything else in the world,&mdash;coffee ice-cream,
and a glass of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you would, or if you only think
it&rsquo;s&mdash;safer. At any rate I&rsquo;m going to put my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' ></a>62</span>
coat over your shoulders while you eat it. I
never leave my rooms at this hour of the night
without this cape. If I can find a place to sit
out in I always do, and I&rsquo;m naturally rather
cold-blooded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Nancy, but she meekly allowed
him to drape her in the folds of the light
cape, and found it grateful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the lady a big cup of coffee, and mind
you have it hot,&rdquo; Collier Pratt ordered peremptorily,
as her ice-cream was served by the
shaking waiter. &ldquo;Coffee may be the worst
thing in the world for you, nervously. I don&rsquo;t
know,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t for me, I rather thrive on it, but
at any rate I&rsquo;m going to save you from the combination
of organdie and ice-cream on a night
like this. What is your name?&rdquo; he inquired
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at my service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&mdash;but I hope and trust
so. I like you. You&rsquo;ve got something they
don&rsquo;t have&mdash;these American girls,&mdash;softness
and strength, too. I imagine you&rsquo;ve never been
out of America.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' ></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With two other girls and a chaperon, doing
Europe, and staying at all the hotels doped up
for tourist consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy was constrained to answer with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like America very much,&rdquo; she
said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it for itself, but I loathe it&mdash;for
myself. My way of living here is all wrong. I
can&rsquo;t get to bed in this confounded city. I can&rsquo;t
get enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Nancy cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paris, or any town where there is a caf&eacute;
life one naturally gets fed. The technique of
living is taken care of much better over there.
Your <i>concierge</i> serves you a nourishing breakfast
as a matter of course. When you&rsquo;ve done
your morning&rsquo;s work you go to your favorite
caf&eacute;&mdash;not with the one object in life&mdash;to cram
a <i>Ch&acirc;teaubriand</i> down your dry and resisting
throat because he who labors must live,&mdash;but to
see your friends, to read your daily journals,
to write your letters, and do it incidentally in
the open air while some diplomat of a waiter
serves you with food that assuages the palate,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' ></a>64</span>
without insulting your mood. That&rsquo;s what I
like about the little restaurant in the court
there. It&rsquo;s out-of-doors, and you may stay
there without feeling your table is in requisition
for the next man. It&rsquo;s a very polite little
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to get in there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hopes of it. I&rsquo;ve not dined, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dined?&rdquo; Nancy&rsquo;s eyes widened in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use for me to dine unless I can
eat my food tranquilly, in some accustomed corner.
Getting nourished with me is a spiritual,
as well as a physical matter. It is with all
sensitive people. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. I&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it
that way. Couldn&rsquo;t you eat something now&mdash;an
oyster stew, or something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in any way remotely connected with
that. An oyster stew is to me the most barbarous
of concoctions. I loathe hot milk,&mdash;an
oyster is an adjunct to a fish sauce, or a
preface to a good dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have something,&rdquo; Nancy
urged, &ldquo;even ice-cream is more nourishing than
mineral water, or coffee with cream in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' ></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I like coffee after dinner, not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you only eat when it&rsquo;s convenient, or the
mood takes you,&rdquo; Nancy cried out in real distress,
&ldquo;how can you ever be sure that you have
calories enough? The requirement of an average
man at active labor is estimated at over
three thousand calories. You must have something
like a balanced ration in order to do your
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; Collier Pratt smiled his rare
smile. &ldquo;Well, at any rate, it is good to hear you
say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finished her ice-cream, and Collier Pratt
drank his mineral water slowly, and smoked innumerable
cigarettes of Virginia tobacco. The
conversation which had proceeded so expeditiously
to this point seemed for no apparent
reason, suddenly to become gratuitous. Nancy
had never before begun on the subject of the
balanced ration without being respectfully allowed
to go through to the end. She had not
been allowed to feel snubbed, but she was a little
bewildered that any conversation in which
she was participating, could be so gracefully
stopped before it was ended by her expressed
desire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' ></a>66</span></div>
<p>Collier Pratt took his watch out of his pocket,
and looked at it hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had entirely forgotten.
I have a child in my charge. I must be
about looking after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child?&rdquo; Nancy cried, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little girl. She&rsquo;s probably sitting up
for me, poor baby. Can you get home alone,
if I put you on a bus or a street-car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll call a taxi for me&mdash;&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>
<p>She noticed that the check was paid with
change instead of a bill. In fact, her host
seemed not to have a bill of any denomination
in his pocket, but to be undisturbed by the fact.
He parted from her casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, child,&rdquo; he said with his head in the
door after he had given the chauffeur her street
number; &ldquo;with the permission of <i>le bon Dieu</i>,
we shall see each other again. I feel that He is
going to give it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; Nancy said to his retreating
shoulder.</p>
<p>At her own front door was Dick&rsquo;s big Rolls-Royce,
and Dick sitting inside of it, with his
feet comfortably up, feigning sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go home until I saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' ></a>67</span>
you safe inside your own door, did you?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo; Nancy asked mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent Williams home with her. Then he
came back here, and left the car with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have waited,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry, Dick, I&mdash;I had to have air. I had to get
out. I couldn&rsquo;t stay inside a minute longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need never explain anything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know where I&rsquo;ve been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked at her carefully before he made
his answer. Then he said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have told you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you had
wanted to know.&rdquo; She felt her knees sagging
with fatigue, and drooped against the door-frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and sit in the car, and talk to me for
a minute,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Do you good, before
you climb the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the car door for her ingratiatingly,
but she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done unconventional things enough for
one evening,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Unlock the door for
me. Hitty&rsquo;ll be waiting up to take care of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that queer thing you&rsquo;re wearing?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' ></a>68</span>
he asked her, as he held the door for her to pass
through, &ldquo;I never remember seeing you wear
that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy looked down wonderingly at the folds
of the Inverness still swinging from her shoulders.
She had been subconsciously aware of
the grateful warmth in which she was encased
ever since she snuggled comfortably into the
depths of the taxi-cab into which Collier Pratt
had tucked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never <i>have</i> worn it before,&rdquo; she said,
answering Dick&rsquo;s question.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Science</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>The activities of the day at Outside Inn began
with luncheon and the preparation for
it. Nancy longed to serve breakfast there, but
as yet it had not seemed practicable to do so.
Most of the patrons of the restaurant conducted
the business of the day down-town, but
had their actual living quarters in New York&rsquo;s
remoter fastnesses,&mdash;Brooklyn, the Bronx or
Harlem. Nancy was satisfied that the bulk of
her patronage should be the commuting and
cliff dwelling contingent of Manhattanites,&mdash;indeed
it was the sort of patronage that from
the beginning she had intended to cater to.</p>
<p>Nancy did most of the marketing herself at
first, but Gaspard&mdash;the big cook&mdash;gradually
coaxed this privilege away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we sit&mdash;us together, and
talk of eating&rdquo;&mdash;he prided himself on his use
of English, and never used his native tongue
to help him out, except in moments of great excitement.
&ldquo;It is immediately after breakfast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' ></a>70</span>
Yes! I am full of milk-coffee sopped with
bread, and you of bacon with eggs and marmalade.
We say, what shall we give to our
custom for its dinner and its luncheon? We
think sadly&mdash;we who have but now brushed
away the crumbs of breakfast&mdash;of those who
must sit down so soon to the table groaning
with viands. Therefore we say, &lsquo;Market delicately.
Have the soup clear, the entr&eacute;e light and
the salad green with plenty of vinegar.&rsquo; Even
your calories&mdash;they do not help us much. They
are in quantities so unexpected in the food that
weighs nothing in the scales. We say you shall
go to market and buy these things, and you go.
I stir and walk about, and grow restless for
my <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, and when you return from market,
hungry too, we are not the same people
who had thought our soup should be clear, and
our entr&eacute;e more beautiful than nutritious. If
I go to market myself <i>late</i> I am inspired there
to buy what is right, because by that hour I
have a proper relish and understanding of what
all the world should eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he is right,&rdquo; Nancy said to Billy
afterward in reporting the conversation, &ldquo;I
hate to admit it, but even my notion of what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' ></a>71</span>
other people should eat is colored by my own
relation to food. I never realized before how
little use an intellect is in this matter of food
values. I can actually get up a meal that according
to the tables is scientifically correct
that wouldn&rsquo;t feed anybody if they were hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One banana is equal to a pound and three-quarters
of steak,&rdquo; Billy misquoted helpfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;except
technically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t eat it and grow thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t eat it and grow <i>fat</i> unless it happens
to be the peculiar food to which you are
idiosyncratic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s really a word,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll overlook
your trying it out on me. If it isn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll
have to take the consequences.&rdquo; He went
through the pantomime of one preparing to do
physical violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a word. Ask Caroline.&rdquo; Nancy&rsquo;s
eyes still held their look of being focussed on
something in the remote distance. &ldquo;The trouble
with all this dietetic problem is that the individual
is dependent on something more than
an adjustment of values. His environment and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' ></a>72</span>
his heredity play an active part in his diet
problem. Some people can eat highly concentrated
food, others have to have bulk, and so
on. You can&rsquo;t substitute cheese and bananas
for steak and do the race a service no matter
what the cost of steak may soar to. You can&rsquo;t
even substitute rice for potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless your patronage is more Oriental
than Celtic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Healthy people have to have honest fare of
about the type to which their environment has
accustomed them, but intelligently supervised,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;my general
notion has always been that everybody ate
wrong, and that everybody who would stand
for it ought to be started all over again. I
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it, so I&rsquo;ve never looked into
the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t eat wrong, that&rsquo;s the really
startling discovery I&rsquo;ve made recently. I mean
healthy people don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Billy; &ldquo;the way people
eat is one of the most outrageous of the
human scandals. I read the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newspapers don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nancy said;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' ></a>73</span>
&ldquo;the individual usually has an instinctive working
knowledge of the diet that is good for him,
and his digestional experiences have taught him
how to regulate it to some extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for the clerk that orders
coffee and sinkers at Child&rsquo;s every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly it,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;He knows
that he needs bulk and stimulation. He&rsquo;s handicapped
by his poverty, but he gets the nearest
substitute for the diet that suits him that he
can get. If he could afford it he would have a
square meal that would nourish him as well as
warm and fill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see but what this interesting theory
lets you out altogether. Why Outside Inn, with
its foxy table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, if what&rsquo;s one man&rsquo;s meat
is another man&rsquo;s poison, and natural selection
is the order of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside Inn is all the more necessary to the
welfare of a nation that&rsquo;s being starved out by
the high cost of living. All I need to do is to
have a little more variety, to have all the nutritive
requirements in each meal, and such
generous servings that every patron can make
out a meal satisfying to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows that all fat people eat all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' ></a>74</span>
the sweets that they can get, and all thin people
take tea without sugar with lemon in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people aren&rsquo;t healthy. That&rsquo;s where
the intelligent supervision comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch over them a little more carefully.
Regulate their servings craftily. Be sure of
my tables. I have lots of schemes. I&rsquo;ll tell you
about them sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sometime</i>,&mdash;for this relief much thanks,&rdquo;
murmured Billy; &ldquo;just now I&rsquo;ve had as much
of these matters as I can stand. I don&rsquo;t see how
you are going to run this thing on a profit,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing money
every minute. That fifteen thousand dollars is
almost gone now, of course. Billy, do you think
it would be perfectly awful if I didn&rsquo;t try to
make money at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be a good deal wiser. I&rsquo;ll
raise all the money you want on your expectations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then. I&rsquo;m not going to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy looked down into the courtyard from
the room up-stairs in which they had been talking.
Already the preparations for lunch were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' ></a>75</span>
under way. The girls were moving deftly
about, laying cloths and arranging flower vases
and silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I get right down there and sit down at
one of those tables and have my lunch,&rdquo; Billy
inquired, &ldquo;or do I have to go out of the back
door and come in the front like a regular customer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever you prefer. There&rsquo;s Caroline
coming in at the gate now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I know which I prefer,&rdquo; Billy
said, swimming realistically toward the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting fat, Billy,&rdquo; Caroline informed
him critically after the amenities were
over, and the meal appropriately begun. &ldquo;You
ought to watch your diet a little more carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Billy said firmly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to watch
my diet, I&rsquo;m perfectly healthy, and therefore
my natural cravings will point the way to my
most judicious nourishment. Nancy has explained
all to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very interesting theory of
Nancy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Caroline said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t altogether
agree with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Billy, then he added hastily, &ldquo;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' ></a>76</span>
I agree with you, too, Caroline. You are to
all other women what moonlight is to sunlight,
or I mean&mdash;what sunlight is to moonlight. In
other words&mdash;you are the goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing in all this wide universe
that you can&rsquo;t say to me, Caroline, and
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t be silly, Billy,&rsquo; is that thing,&mdash;express
this same thing in <i>vers libre</i> if you must say
it! Look at the handsome soup you&rsquo;re getting.
What is the name of that soup, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled ingratiatingly at the little waitress,
who always beamed at any one of Nancy&rsquo;s
particular friends that came into the restaurant,
and made a point of serving them if she
could possibly arrange it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cream of spinach,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a special
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful soup so rich and green,&rdquo; Billy began
in a soulful baritone, &ldquo;waiting in a hot
tureen. Where&rsquo;s mine, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolly&rsquo;s bringing your first course, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy gazed in perplexity at the half of a delicious
grapefruit set before him by the duplicate
of the pretty girl who stood smiling deprecatingly
behind Caroline&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' ></a>77</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my soup, Dolly?&rdquo; Billy asked with
a thundering sternness of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir,&rdquo; Dolly began glibly, &ldquo;but the
soup has given out. Will you be good enough
to allow the substitution of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a formula,&rdquo; Billy said. &ldquo;The soup
can&rsquo;t be out. We&rsquo;re the first people in the dining-room.
Go tell Miss Nancy that I will be
served with some of that green soup at once, or
know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two waitresses exchanged glances, and
went off together suppressing giggles, to return
almost immediately, their risibility still causing
them great physical inconvenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligent supervision, she says.&rdquo; Dolly
exploded into the miniature patch of muslin
and ribbon that served her as an apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says that&rsquo;s the reason why,&rdquo; Molly contributed,&mdash;following
her sister&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy doesn&rsquo;t serve soup to a fat man if she
can possibly avoid it. That&rsquo;s part of her theory,&rdquo;
Caroline explained. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use making a
fuss about it, because you won&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy sat looking at his grapefruit for some
seconds in silence. Then he began on it slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' ></a>78</span></div>
<p>Nancy was learning a great many things
very rapidly. The practical application of her
theories of feeding mankind to her actual experiments
with the shifting population of New
York, revolutionized her attitude toward the
problem almost daily. She had started in with
a great many ideas and ideals of service, with
preconceived notions of balanced rations, and
exact distribution of fuel stuffs to the human
unit. She had come to realize very shortly, that
the human unit was a quantity as incalculable
in its relation to its digestive problems as its
psychological ones. She had believed vaguely
that in reference to food values the race made
its great exception to its rule of working out
toward normality; but she changed that opinion
very quickly as she watched her fellow men
selecting their diet with as sure an instinct for
their nutritive requirements as if she had
coached them personally for years.</p>
<p>From the assumption that she lived in a
world gone dietetically mad, and hence in the
process of destroying itself, she had gradually
come to see that in this phase of his struggle
for existence, as well as in every other, the instinct
of man operated automatically in the direction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' ></a>79</span>
of his salvation. This new attitude in
tie matter relieved her of much of her responsibility,
but left her not less anxious to do what
she could for her kind in the matter of calories.
She was, as she had shown in her treatment of
Billy, not entirely blinded by her growing predilection
in favor of the doctrine of natural
selection.</p>
<p>Every day she had Gaspard make, in addition
to his regular table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te menu, dozens of
nutritive custards, quarts of stimulating broths
and jellies and other dishes containing the maximum
of easily digested and highly concentrated
nutriment, and these she managed to
have Molly or Dolly or even Hildeguard&mdash;the
Alma Tadema girl&mdash;introduce into the luncheon
or dinner service in the case of those patrons
who seemed to need peculiarly careful nourishing.
Let a white-faced girl sink into a seat
within the range of Nancy&rsquo;s vision,&mdash;she always
ensconced herself in the doorway screened
with vines at the beginning of a meal,&mdash;and she
gave orders at once for the crafty substitution
of invalid broth for soup, of rich nut bread for
the ordinary rolls and crackers, of custards or
specially made ice-cream for the dessert of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' ></a>80</span>
day. No overfed, pasty-faced man ever escaped
from Outside Inn until an attempt at
least had been made to introduce a portion of
stewed prunes into his diet; and all such were
fed the minimum of bread and other starchy
foods, and the maximum of salad and green
vegetables. Nancy had gluten bread made in
quantities for the stouter element of her patronage,
and in nine cases out of ten she was
able to get it served and eaten without protest.
Some of her regular patrons began to change
weight gradually, a heavy man or two became
less heavy, and a wraithlike girl now and then
took on a new bloom and substantiality. These
were the triumphs for which Nancy lived. Her
only regret was that she was not able to give
to each her personal time and attention, and establish
herself on a footing with her patrons
where she might learn from their own lips the
secrets of their metabolism.</p>
<p>She was not known as the proprietor of the
place. In fact, the management of the restaurant
was kept a careful secret from those who
frequented it and with the habitual indifference
of New Yorkers to the power behind the throne,
so long as its affairs were manipulated in good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' ></a>81</span>
and regular order, they soon ceased to feel any
apparent curiosity about it. Betty, who sometimes
rebelled at remaining so scrupulously incognita,
defiantly took the limelight at intervals
and moved among the assembled guests with an
authoritative and possessive air, adjusting and
rearranging small details, and acknowledging
the presence of <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>, but since her attentions
were popularly supposed to be those of a
superior head waitress, she soon tired of the
gesture of offering them.</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s intention had been to allow the restaurant
to speak for itself, and then at the climactic
moment to allow her connection with it
to be discovered, and to speak for it with all
the force and earnestness of which she was
capable. She had meant to stand sponsor for
the practical working theory on which her experiment
was based, and she had already partially
formulated interviews with herself in
which she modestly acknowledged the success
of that experiment, but the untoward direction
in which it was developing made such a revelation
inexpedient.</p>
<p>There was one regular patron to whom she
was peculiarly anxious to remain incognita.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' ></a>82</span>
Collier Pratt made it his almost invariable
habit to come sauntering toward the table in
the corner, under the life-sized effigy of the <i>V&ecirc;nus
de Medici</i>, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
and that table was scrupulously reserved for
him. To it were sent the choicest of all the
viands that Outside Inn could command. Michael
was tacitly sped on his way with his teapot
full of claret. Gaspard did amazing things
with the breasts of ducks and segments of
orange, with squab chicken stuffed with new
corn, with <i>filets de sole a la Marguery</i>. Nancy
craftily spurred him on to his most ambitious
achievements under pretense of wishing her
own appetite stimulated, and the big cook, who
adored her, produced triumph after triumph
of his art for her delectation, whereupon the
biggest part of it was cunningly smuggled out
to the artist. From behind her screen of vines
Nancy watched the fine features of her quondam
friend light with the rapture of the <i>gourmet</i>
as be sampled Gaspard&rsquo;s sauce <i>verte</i> or
Hollandaise or lifted the glass cover from the
mushrooms <i>sous cloche</i> and inhaled their delicate
aroma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he finds our food very American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' ></a>83</span>
in character, now,&rdquo; she said to herself,
with a blush at the memory of the real southern
cornbread and candied sweet potatoes that were
offered him in the initial weeks of his patronage.
Gaspard still made these delicacies for
luncheon, but they had been almost entirely
banished from the dinner menu. Afternoon
tea at the Inn was famous for the wonderful
waffles produced with Parisian precision from
a traditional Virginian recipe, but Collier Pratt
never appeared at either of these meals to criticize
them for being American.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>An Eleemosynary Institution</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>One night during the latter part of July
Betty had a birthday, and according to
immemorial custom Caroline and Nancy and
Dick and Billy helped her to celebrate it at one
of the old-fashioned down-town hotels where
they had ordered practically the same dinner
for her anniversaries ever since they had been
grown up enough to celebrate them unchaperoned.
Caroline&rsquo;s brother, Preston, had made
a sixth member of the party for the first two or
three years, but he had been located in London
since then, in charge of the English office of his
firm, to which he had been suddenly appointed
a month after he and Betty, who had been
sweethearts, had had a spectacular quarrel.</p>
<p>Nancy stayed by the celebration until about
half past nine, and then Dick put her into a
taxi-cab, and she fled back to her responsibilities
as mistress of Outside Inn, agreeing to
meet the others later for the rounding out of
the evening. As she drew up before the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' ></a>85</span>
gate the courtyard seemed practically deserted.
The waitresses were busy clearing away the
few cluttered tables left by the last late guests,
and in one sheltered corner a man and a girl
were frankly holding hands across the table,
while they whispered earnestly of some impending
parting. The big canopy of striped awning
cloth had been drawn over the tables, as the
rather heavy air of the evening bad been punctured
occasionally by a swift scattering of rain.
Nancy was half-way across the court before she
realized that Collier Pratt was still occupying
his accustomed seat under the shadow of the
big Venus. She had not seen him face to face
or communicated with him since the day she
had looked him up in the telephone book and
sent his cape to him by special messenger. She
stopped involuntarily as she reached his side,
and he looked up and smiled as he recognized
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late again, Miss Ann Martin,&rdquo; he
said, rising and pulling out a chair for her opposite
his own. &ldquo;I think perhaps I can pull the
wires and procure you some sustenance if you
will say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no word to say,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' ></a>86</span>
do you do? I&rsquo;ve just dined elsewhere. I only
stopped in here for a moment to get something&mdash;something
I left here at lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll offer you a drop of Michael&rsquo;s
tea in my water glass.&rdquo; He poured a tablespoonful
or so of claret from the teapot into
the glass of ice-water before him, and added
several lumps of sugar to the concoction, which
he stirred gravely for some time before he offered
it to her. &ldquo;I never touch water myself.
This is <i>eau rougie</i> as the French children drink
it. It&rsquo;s really better for you than ice-cream and
a glass of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And less American,&rdquo; Nancy murmured with
her eyes down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And less American,&rdquo; he acquiesced blandly.</p>
<p>Nancy sipped her drink, and Collier Pratt
stirred the dregs in his coffee cup&mdash;Nancy had
overheard some of her patrons remarking on
the curious habits of a man who consumed a
pot of tea and a pot of coffee at one and the
same meal&mdash;and they regarded each other for
some time in silence. Michael and Hildeguard,
Molly and Dolly and two others of the staff of
girls were grouped in the doorway exactly in
Nancy&rsquo;s range of vision, and whispering to one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' ></a>87</span>
another excitedly concerning the phenomenon
that met their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little girl?&rdquo; Nancy said, trying to ignore
the composite scrutiny to which she was being
subjected, by turning determinedly to her companion,
&ldquo;the little girl that you spoke of&mdash;is she
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as well as a motherless baby could
be, subjected to the irregularities of a life like
mine. Still she seems to thrive on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she yours?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said, gravely
dismissing the subject, and leaving Nancy half
ashamed of her boldness in putting the question,
half possessed of a madness to know the
answer at any cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered something very interesting,&rdquo;
Collier Pratt said, after an interval in which
Nancy felt that he was perfectly cognizant of
her struggle with her curiosity; &ldquo;in fact, it&rsquo;s
one of the most interesting discoveries that I
have made in the course of a not unadventurous
life. Do you come to this restaurant often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite often,&rdquo; Nancy equivocated, &ldquo;earlier in
the day. For luncheon and for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come here almost every night of my life,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' ></a>88</span>
Collier Pratt declared, &ldquo;and I intend to continue
to come so long as <i>le bon Dieu</i> spares me my
health and my epicurean taste. You know that
I spoke of the food here before. The character
of it has changed entirely. It&rsquo;s unmistakably
French now, not to say Parisian. Outside of
Paris or Vienna I have never tasted such soups,
such sauce, such delicate and suggestive flavors.
My entire existence has been revolutionized by
the experience. I am no longer the lonely and
unhappy man you discovered at this gate a
short month ago. I can not cavil at an America
that furnishes me with such food as I get in
this place.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Man may live without friends, and may live without books.</p>
<p>But civilized man can not live without cooks,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
<p class='ni'>Nancy quoted sententiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. The whole point is that the cooking
here is civilized. Oh! you ought to come
here to dinner, my friend. I don&rsquo;t know what
the luncheons and teas are like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very good,&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not like the dinners, I&rsquo;ll wager. The
dinners are the very last word! I don&rsquo;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' ></a>89</span>
why this place isn&rsquo;t famous. Of course, I do
my best to keep it a secret from the artistic
rabble I know. It would be overrun with them
in a week, and its character utterly ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your discovery?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt leaned dramatically closer to
her, and Nancy instinctively bent forward
across the tiny table until her face was very
near to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about the price of
foodstuffs?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Nancy admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know then that the price of every commodity
has soared unthinkably high, that the
mere problem of providing the ordinary commonplace
meal at the ordinary commonplace
restaurant has become almost unsolvable to the
proprietors? Most of the eating places in New
York are run at a loss, while the management
is marking time and praying for a change in
conditions. Well, here we have a restaurant
opening at the most crucial period in the history
of such enterprises, offering its patrons
the delicacies of the season most exquisitely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' ></a>90</span>
cooked, at what is practically the minimum
price for a respectable meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that, there are people who come
here, who order one thing and get another, and
the thing they get is always a much more elaborate
and extravagant dish than the one they
asked for. I&rsquo;ve seen that happen again and
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; Nancy asked faintly, shrinking
a little beneath the intentness of his look. &ldquo;How&mdash;how
do you account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way to account for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that there is an&mdash;an unlimited
amount of capital behind it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that goes without saying,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;there must be an unlimited amount of capital
behind it, or it wouldn&rsquo;t continue to flourish
like a green bay tree; but that&rsquo;s not in the nature
of a discovery. Anybody with any power
of observation at all would have come to that
conclusion long since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what is it you have found out?&rdquo;
Nancy asked, quaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My discovery is&mdash;&rdquo; Collier Pratt paused for
the whole effect of his revelation to penetrate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' ></a>91</span>
to her consciousness, &ldquo;that this whole outfit is
run <i>philanthropically</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philanthropically?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? There can&rsquo;t be any other
explanation of it. It&rsquo;s an eleemosynary institution.
That&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy met his expectant eyes with a trifle
of wildness in her own, but he continued to
hold her gaze triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t everything
point to that as the only possible explanation?
It&rsquo;s some rich woman&rsquo;s plaything. That
accounts for the food, the setting,&mdash;everything
in fact that has puzzled us. Amateur,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the word; effective, delightful but inexperienced.
It sticks out all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food isn&rsquo;t amateur,&rdquo; Nancy said, a little
resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is amateur but the spirit behind it,
through which we profit. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to see,&rdquo; Nancy admitted,
&ldquo;perhaps you are right. I guess the place is
run philanthropically. I&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t quite realized
it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that the&mdash;one who was running it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' ></a>92</span>
wasn&rsquo;t quite sure where she was coming out,
but I didn&rsquo;t think of it is an eleemosynary institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unscrupulous sort of charity, then,&rdquo;
Nancy mused, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s masquerading as self-respecting
and self-supporting. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never approved
of things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why quarrel with a scheme so beneficent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care?&rdquo; Nancy asked with a catch
in her voice that was very like an appeal.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t care, either,&rdquo; she decided with
an emphasis that was entirely lost on the man
on the other side of the table.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_VII_CAVEMAN_STUFF'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Cave-man Stuff</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;Cave-man stuff,&rdquo; Billy said to Dick,
pointing a thumb over his shoulder
toward the interior of the Broadway moving-picture
palace at the exit of which they had
just met accidentally. &ldquo;It always goes big,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; Dick agreed thoughtfully, &ldquo;in the
movies anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline says that the modern woman has
her response to that kind of thing refined all
out of her.&rdquo; Billy intended his tone to be entirely
jocular, but there was a note of anxiety
in it that was not lost on his friend.</p>
<p>Dick paused under the shelter of a lurid poster&mdash;displaying
a fierce gentleman in crude
blue, showing all his teeth, and in the act of
strangling an early Victorian ingenue with a
dimple,&mdash;and lit a cigarette with his first match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline may have,&rdquo; he said, puffing to keep
his light against the breeze, &ldquo;but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' ></a>94</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Rough stuff doesn&rsquo;t seem to appeal to her,&rdquo;
Billy said, quite humorously this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s healthy,&rdquo; Dick mused, &ldquo;rides horseback,
plays tennis and all that. Wouldn&rsquo;t she
have liked the guy that swung himself on the
roof between the two poles?&rdquo; He indicated
again the direction of the theater from which
they had just emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have liked him,&rdquo; Billy said gloomily,
&ldquo;but the show would have started her
arguing about this whole moving-picture
proposition,&mdash;its crudity, and its tremendous
sacrifice of artistic values, and so on and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, she&rsquo;s a highbrow. Highbrows always
cerebrate about the movies in one way or another.
Nancy doesn&rsquo;t get it at just that angle,
of course. She hasn&rsquo;t got Caroline&rsquo;s intellectual
appetite. She&rsquo;s not interested in the movies because
she hasn&rsquo;t got a moving-picture house of
her own. The world is not Nancy&rsquo;s oyster&mdash;it&rsquo;s
her lump of putty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which is the worst,&rdquo; Billy said.
&ldquo;Caroline won&rsquo;t listen to anything you say to
her,&mdash;but then neither will Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women never listen to anything,&rdquo; Dick said
profoundly, &ldquo;unless they&rsquo;re doing it on purpose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' ></a>95</span>
or they happen to be interested. I imagine
Caroline is a little less tractable, but
Nancy is capable of doing the most damage.
She works with concrete materials. Caroline&rsquo;s
kit is crammed with nothing but ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing <i>but</i>&mdash;&rdquo; Billy groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for this cave-man business&mdash;theoretically,
they ought to react to it,&mdash;both of them.
They&rsquo;re both normal, well-balanced young
ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both runnin&rsquo; pretty hard to keep in
the same place, just at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy isn&rsquo;t doing that&mdash;not by a long shot,&rdquo;
Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not keeping in the same place certainly,&rdquo;
Billy agreed. &ldquo;Caroline is all eaten up
by this economic independence idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Dick admitted; &ldquo;economic
conditions are changing. No reason at all that
a woman shouldn&rsquo;t prove herself willing to cope
with them, as long as she gets things in the order
of their importance. Earning her living
isn&rsquo;t better than the Mother-Home-and-Heaven
job. It&rsquo;s a way out, if she gets left, or gets
stung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only thankful Caroline can&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' ></a>96</span>
Billy raised pious eyes to heaven but he continued
more seriously after a second, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right to theorize, but practically speaking both
our girls are getting beyond our control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not engaged to Nancy,&rdquo; Dick said a trifle
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to be,&rdquo; Billy said.</p>
<p>Dick stiffened. He was not used to speaking
of his relations with Nancy to any one&mdash;even
to Billy, who was the closest friend he had.
They walked up Broadway in silence for a
while, toward the cross-street which housed the
university club which was their common objective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I ought to be,&rdquo; Dick said, just as
Billy was formulating an apology for his presumption,
&ldquo;or I ought to marry her out of hand.
This watchful waiting&rsquo;s entirely the wrong
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we do it then?&rdquo; Billy inquired pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted Nancy to sow her economic wild
oats. I guess you felt the same way about
Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve sowed &rsquo;em, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a long shot. That&rsquo;s the trouble,&mdash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' ></a>97</span>
don&rsquo;t get any forrider, from our point of
view. I thought it would be the best policy to
stand by and let Nancy work it out. I thought
her restaurant would either fail spectacularly
in a month, or succeed brilliantly and she&rsquo;d
make over the executive end of it to somebody
else. I never thought of her buckling down
like this, and wearing herself out at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pretty keen edge on Caroline this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Nancy&rsquo;s in pretty deep,&rdquo; Dick
said. &ldquo;The money end of it worries me as much
as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let that worry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t take any of mine, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she won&rsquo;t. See here, Dick, I wouldn&rsquo;t
worry about Nancy&rsquo;s finances. She&rsquo;ll come out
all right about money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know so. We&rsquo;ve got lots of things in the
world to worry about, things that are scheduled
to go wrong unless we&rsquo;re mighty delicate in the
way we handle &rsquo;em. Let&rsquo;s worry about <i>them</i>,
and leave Nancy&rsquo;s financial problems to take
care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;that you are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' ></a>98</span>
sure that she&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m not in her confidence
in this matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am,&rdquo; Billy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m her legal adviser,
and with all due respect to your taste
in girls, it&rsquo;s a very difficult position to occupy.
What with the things she won&rsquo;t listen to and
the things she won&rsquo;t learn, and the things she
actually knows more about than I do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indulgent smile of the true lover lit
Dick&rsquo;s face, as if Billy had waxed profoundly
eulogistic. Unconsciously, Billy&rsquo;s own tenderness
took fire at the flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we run away with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he said,
breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Dick stopped in a convenient doorway to light
his third cigarette, end on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the answer to you and Caroline,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not to you and Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;I dunno. I&rsquo;ve
reached an <i>impasse</i>. Still there is a great deal
in your proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned in at the portico that extended
out over the big oak doors of their club. An
attendant in white turned the knob for them,
with the grin of enthusiastic welcome that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' ></a>99</span>
the usual tribute to these two good-looking,
well set up young men from those who served
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; Dick added, as he gave
up his hat and stick, &ldquo;and let you know what
decision I come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another five minutes they were deep in a
game of Kelly-pool from which Dick emerged
triumphantly richer by the sum of a dollar and
ninety cents, and Billy the poorer by the loss
of a quarter.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There is a town in Connecticut, within a reasonable
motoring distance from New York that
has been called the Gretna Green of America.
Here well-informed young couples are able to
expedite the business of matrimony with a phenomenal
neatness and despatch. Licenses can
be procured by special dispensation, and the
nuptial knot tied as solemnly and solidly as if a
premeditated train of bridesmaids and flower
girls and loving relatives had been rehearsed
for days in advance.</p>
<p>Dick and his Rolls-Royce had assisted at a
hymeneal celebration or two, where a successful
rush had been made for the temporary altars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' ></a>100</span>
of this beneficent town with the most felicitous
results, and he knew the procedure.
When he and Billy organized an afternoon excursion
into Connecticut, they tacitly avoided
all mention of the consummation they hoped to
bring about, but they both understood the nature
and significance of the expedition. Dick,&mdash;who
was used to the easy accomplishment of his
designs and purposes, for most obstacles gave
way before his magnetic onslaught,&mdash;had only
sketchily outlined his scheme of proceedings,
but he trusted to the magic of that inspiration
that seldom or never failed him. He was
the sort of young man that the last century
novelists always referred to as &ldquo;fortune&rsquo;s
favorite,&rdquo; and his luck so rarely betrayed him
that he had almost come to believe it to be
invincible.</p>
<p>His general idea was to get Nancy and Caroline
to drive into the country, through the cool
rush of the freer purer air of the suburbs, give
them lunch at some smart road-house, soothingly
restful and dim, where the temperature
was artificially lowered, and they could powder
their noses at will; and from thence go on until
they were within the radius of the charmed circle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' ></a>101</span>
where modern miracles were performed
while the expectant bridegroom waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, my dear, we are going to be married,&rdquo;&mdash;that
he had formulated, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to
be done with all this nonsense of waiting and
doubting the evidence of our own senses and
our own hearts. We&rsquo;re going to put an end to
the folly of trying to do without each other,&mdash;your
folly of trying to feed all itinerant New
York; my folly of standing by and letting you
do it, or any other fool thing that your fancy
happens to dictate. You&rsquo;re mine and I&rsquo;m yours,
and I&rsquo;m going to take you&mdash;take you to-day and
prove it to you.&rdquo; This was to be timed to be
delivered at just about the moment when they
drew up in front of the office of the justice of
the peace, who was Dick&rsquo;s friend of old. &ldquo;Hold
up your head, my dear, and put your hat on
straight; we&rsquo;re going into that building to be
made man and wife, and we&rsquo;re not coming out
of it until the deed has been done.&rdquo; In some
such fashion, he meant to carry it through.
Many a time in the years gone by he had
steered Nancy through some high-handed escapade
that she would only have consented to
on the spur of the moment. She was one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' ></a>102</span>
these women who responded automatically to
the voice of a master. He had failed in mastery
this last year or so. That was the secret of his
failure with her, but the days of that failure
were numbered now. He was going to succeed.</p>
<p>On the back seat of the big car he expected
Billy and Caroline to be going through much
the same sort of scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to a show-down now, Caroline,&mdash;either
I sit in this game, or get out.&rdquo; He
could imagine Billy bringing Caroline bluntly
to terms with comparatively little effort. That
was what she needed&mdash;Caroline&mdash;a strong
hand. Billy&rsquo;s problem was simple. Caroline
had already signified her preference for him.
She wore his ring. Billy had only to pick her
up, kicking and screaming if need be, and
bear her to the altar. She would marry him
if he insisted. That was clear to the most superficial
of observers,&mdash;but Nancy was different.</p>
<p>The day was hot, and grew steadily hotter.
By the time Nancy and Caroline were actually
in the car, after an almost superhuman
effort to assemble them and their various
accessories of veils and wraps, and to dispose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' ></a>103</span>
of the assortment of errands and messages
that both girls seemed to be committed to despatch
before they could pass the boundaries of
Greater New York, the two men were very
nearly exhausted. It was only when the chauffeur
let the car out to a speed greatly in excess
of the limitations on some clear stretch of road,
that the breath of the country brought them
any relief whatsoever.</p>
<p>Dick looked over his shoulder at the two in
the back seat, and noted Caroline&rsquo;s pallor, and
the fact that she was allowing a listless hand
to linger in Billy&rsquo;s; but when he turned back
to Nancy he discovered no such encouraging
symptoms. She was sitting lightly relaxed at
his side, but there was nothing even negatively
responsive in her attitude. Her color was high;
her breath coming evenly from between her
slightly parted lips. She looked like a child
oblivious to everything but some innocent daydream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as if you were dreaming of candy
and kisses, Nancy,&mdash;are you?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m just glad to be free. It&rsquo;s been a
long time since I&rsquo;ve played hooky.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' ></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo; The &ldquo;dear&rdquo; constrained him,
and he did not add it: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working
most unholy hard. I&mdash;I hate to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was never so happy in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; His voice hoarsened with the
effort to keep it steady and casual. &ldquo;Is everything
going all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is the money end of it all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, I am not worrying about
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not making money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not losing any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;a little. That was to be expected,
don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much are you losing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know. Are you keeping your
own books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty helps me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you losing a hundred a month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' ></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nancy answered recklessly, &ldquo;the way
I run it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, of course;&rdquo;
Dick said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got all my money behind
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s money behind me except
my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had fifteen thousand dollars. Do you
mean to say that you have any of that left to
draw on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind telling me how you are managing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy borrowed some money for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what security?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, do you realize that you&rsquo;re the most
exasperating woman that ever walked the face
of this earth?&rdquo; the unhappy lover asked.</p>
<p>Nancy managed to convey the fact that Dick&rsquo;s
asseveration both surprised and pained her,
without resorting to the use of words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' ></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t spoil this lovely party,&rdquo;
she said to him a few seconds later. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
extremely tired, and I should like to get my
mind off my business instead of going over
these tiresome details with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look very innocent and kind and loving,&rdquo;
Dick said desperately, &ldquo;but at heart
you&rsquo;re a little fraud, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She interrupted him to point out two children
laden with wild flowers, trudging along the
roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how adorably dirty and happy they are,&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;That little fellow has his shoestrings
untied, and keeps tripping on them, he&rsquo;s
so tired, but he&rsquo;s so crazy about the posies that
he doesn&rsquo;t care. I wonder if he&rsquo;s taking them
home to his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re devoted to children, Nancy, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s voice softened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, and some day I&rsquo;m going to
adopt a whole orphan asylum,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice
altered in a way that Dick did not in the
least understand. &ldquo;I could if I wanted to,&rdquo;
she laughed. &ldquo;Maybe I will want to some
day. So many of my ideas are being changed
and modified by experience.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' ></a>107</span></div>
<p>The road-house of his choice, when they
reached it, proved to have deteriorated sadly
since his last visit. The cool interior that he
remembered had been inopportunely opened to
the hottest blast of the day&rsquo;s heat, and hermetically
sealed again, or at least so it seemed
to Dick; and the furniture was all red and
thickly, almost suffocatingly, upholstered.
Nancy had no comment on the torrid air of
the dining-room,&mdash;she rarely complained about
anything. Even the presence of a fly in her
bouillon jelly scarcely disturbed her equanimity,
but Dick knew that she was secretly
sustained by the conviction that such an
accident was impossible under her system of
supervision at Outside Inn, and resented her
tranquillity accordingly.</p>
<p>Caroline, behaving not so well, seemed to
him a much more human and sympathetic figure,
though her nose took on a high shine
unknown to Nancy&rsquo;s demurer and more discreetly
served features; but Billy evidently
preferred Nancy&rsquo;s deportment, which was on
the surface calm and reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s a sport,&rdquo; he pointed out to Caroline
enthusiastically, &ldquo;no fly in the ointment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' ></a>108</span>
gets her goat. She enjoys herself even when
she&rsquo;s perfectly miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t feel the heat the way I do,&rdquo;
Caroline snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the heat,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a system,&rdquo; Dick cut in savagely:
&ldquo;she stands it just as long as she can, and then
she takes it out of me in some diabolical
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s gray-blue eyes took on the far-away
look that those who loved her had learned to
associate with her most baffling moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just by being especially nice to Dick,&rdquo; she
said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I can make him more furious
with me than in any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy and Caroline finished their sloppy
ices at the table together while Dick and Billy
sought the solace of a pipe in the garage outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand coming into Connecticut
to-day,&rdquo; Nancy said as soon as they were
alone; &ldquo;it seems like such a stupid excursion
for Dick to make. He&rsquo;s usually pretty good
at picking out places to go. In fact, he has a
kind of genius for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' ></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped up this time,&rdquo; Caroline said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Nancy, slumping limply into
the depths of her red velour chair. &ldquo;I want to
get back to New York. Oh! what was it you
told me the other day that you had been saving
up to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caroline brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Why, it was something Collier
Pratt said about you. You know Betty has
scraped up quite an acquaintance with him.
She goes and sits down at his table sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be stopped doing <i>that</i>,&rdquo;
Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you remember the night when you
went home early with a headache, and passed
by his table going out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t know he saw me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sees everything, Betty says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t suspect me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know you came out of the interior.
He said to Betty, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s curious that Miss
Martin never stays here to dine in the evening,
though she so often drops in.&rsquo; Betty is pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' ></a>110</span>
quick, you know. She said, &lsquo;I think Miss Martin
is a friend of the proprietor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;the best friend
she&rsquo;s got. Go on, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he said slowly and thoughtfully, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
a crime for a woman like that not to be the
mother of children. If ever I saw a maternal
type, Miss Ann Martin is the apotheosis of it.
Why some man hasn&rsquo;t made her understand
that long ago I can not see.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s cheeks burned crimson and then
white again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare Betty?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you hear. You know Betty
doesn&rsquo;t care what she says. Her reply to that
was peculiarly Bettyish. She sighed and cast
down her eyes,&mdash;the little imp! &lsquo;The course of
true love never does run smooth,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;perhaps Ann has discovered the truth of that
old saying in some new connection.&rsquo; She
didn&rsquo;t mean to be a cat, she was only trying
to create a romantic interest in your affairs,
doing as she would be done by. The effect was
more than she bargained for though. Collier
Pratt&rsquo;s eyes quite lit up. &lsquo;I can imagine no
greater crime than frustrating the instincts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' ></a>111</span>
of a woman like that,&rsquo; he said. Imagine that&mdash;the
instincts&mdash;whereupon Betty, of course,
flounced off and left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would,&rdquo; Nancy said. Then a storm of
real anger surged through her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn her
out of my place to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll never look at
her or speak to her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be more to the point,&rdquo;
Caroline said, &ldquo;to turn out Collier Pratt.
That was certainly an extraordinary way for
him to speak of you to a girl who is a stranger
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline, you&rsquo;re almost as bad as Betty is.
You&rsquo;re both of you hopelessly&mdash;helplessly&mdash;provincially
American. I don&rsquo;t think that was
extraordinary or impertinent even,&rdquo; Nancy
said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I understand how that man means
things.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The car drove up in front of the office of
the justice of the peace in the town beyond
that in which they had had their unauspicious
luncheon party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we stopping here for any particular
reason?&rdquo; Caroline said.</p>
<p>Nancy had not spoken in more than a monosyllable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' ></a>112</span>
since they had resumed their places in
the car again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Dick said wearily. &ldquo;I thought
I&rsquo;d point out the sights of the town. This
place is called the Gretna Green of America,
you know. A great many runaway couples
come out here to be married. The man inside
that office, the one with whiskers and no collar,
is the one that marries them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; Billy asked a trifle uncertainly.</p>
<p>Nancy turned to Dick with a real appeal in
her voice. It was the first time during the
day that she had addressed him with anything
like her natural tenderness and sweetness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Dick, can&rsquo;t we start on?&rdquo; she said.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Science Applied</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Gaspard was ill&mdash;very ill. He lay in the
little anteroom at the top of the stairs and
groaned thunderously. He had a pain in his
back and a roaring in his head, and an extreme
disorder in the region of his solar plexus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s no more nor less than a
human earthquake,&rdquo; Michael reported after an
examination.</p>
<p>Nancy applied ice caps and hot-water bags
to the afflicted areas without avail. The
stricken man had struggled from his bed in
the Twentieth Street lodging-house that he
had chosen for his habitation, and staggered
through the heavy morning heat to his post in
the basement kitchen of Nancy&rsquo;s Inn, there to
collapse ignominiously between his cooking
ranges. With Molly and Dolly and Hildeguard
at his feet and herself and Michael and a dishwasher
at his head they had managed to get him
up the two short flights of stairs. It developed
that it would be necessary to remove him in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' ></a>114</span>
ambulance later in the day, but for the time
being he lay like a contorted Colossus on the
fragile-looking cot that constituted his improvised
bed of pain: &ldquo;Like the great grandfather,&rdquo;
to quote Michael again, &ldquo;of all of
them Zeus&rsquo;es and gargoyles, and other cavortin&rsquo;
gentlemen in the yard down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the luncheon menu before her, Nancy
decided that the hour had come for her to prove
herself. She had assumed the practical management
of the business of the Inn only to
have the responsibility and much of the
authority of her position taken from her by
the very efficiency of her staff. She was
far too good a business woman not to realize
that this condition was distinctly to her advantage,
and to encourage it accordingly, but
there was still so much of the child in her
that she secretly resented every usurpation of
privilege.</p>
<p>With Gaspard ill she was able to manipulate
the affairs of the kitchen exactly as she chose,
and even in the moment of applying the &ldquo;hot
at the base of the brain and the cold at the
forehead&rdquo; that the doctor had prescribed as
the most effective method for relieving the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' ></a>115</span>
pressure of blood in the tortured temples of the
suffering man, she had been conscious of that
thrill of triumph that most human beings feel
when the involuntary removal of the man
higher up invests them with power.</p>
<p>Michael did the marketing, and the list went
through as Gaspard had planned it, with some
slight adaptations to the exigency, such as the
substitution of twenty-five cans of tomato
soup for the fresh vegetables with which Gaspard
had planned to make his tomato bisque,
and brandied peaches in glass jars instead of
peach souffl&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I allow myself a little handicap in the
matter of details,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know I can put
everything else through as well as Gaspard;&rdquo;
whereupon she enveloped herself in a huge
linen apron, tucked her hair into one of the
chef&rsquo;s white caps, and attacked the problem of
preparing luncheon for from sixty-five to two
hundred people, who were scheduled to appear
at uncertain intervals between the hours of
twelve and two-thirty. Later she must be
ready to serve tea and ices to a problematical
number of patrons, but she tried not to think
beyond the immediate task.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' ></a>116</span></div>
<p>She could make a very good tomato bisque
by adding one cup of milk and a dash of cream
to one half-pint can of MacDonald&rsquo;s tomato
soup, enough to serve three people adequately,
and she proceeded to multiply that recipe by
twenty-five. She didn&rsquo;t think of getting large
cans till Michael in the process of opening the
half-pint tins made the belated suggestion,
which she greeted with some hauteur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the person to mind a little extra
work, Michael, when I am sure of my results.
Precision&mdash;that&rsquo;s the secret of the difference
between American and French cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; sure and I fail to see the difference
between the preciseness of a quart can and
four half-pint ones, but I suppose it&rsquo;s my
ignorance now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your supposition is correct, Michael,&rdquo; she
said airily, but out of the corner of her eye she
saw him smiling to himself over the growing
heap of half-pint tins, and reddened with
mortification at her naivet&eacute; in the matter.</p>
<p>She looked at the vat of terra-cotta pur&eacute;e
with considerable dismay when she had stirred
in the last measure of cream. Twenty-five
pints of tomato bisque is a rather formidable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' ></a>117</span>
quantity of a liquid the chief virtue of which
is its sparing and judicious introduction into
the individual diet scheme. Nancy hardly felt
that she wanted to be alone with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll soon lick it all up, and be polishing
their plates like so many Tom-cats,&rdquo; Michael
said, indicating their potential patronage by
waving his hand toward the courtyard. &ldquo;Here
comes Miss Betty, now. She&rsquo;ll be after lending
a hand in the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her away, Michael,&rdquo; Nancy cried; &ldquo;go
out and head her off. Make her go up-stairs
and sit with Gaspard,&mdash;anything, but don&rsquo;t let
her come in here. If she does I won&rsquo;t answer
for the consequences. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what I&rsquo;ll do to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw her in the soup kettle, most likely,&rdquo;
Michael chuckled. &ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; I never saw a
woman yet that wasn&rsquo;t ready to scratch the
eyes out of the next one that got into her kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo; Nancy said darkly. &ldquo;I need
every bit of brain and self-control I have to
put this luncheon through. You keep Miss
Betty&rsquo;s mind on something else&mdash;anything but
me and the way I am doing the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' ></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis done,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;sure an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll protect
her from you, if I have to abduct her myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would,&rdquo; Nancy said to herself
viciously, &ldquo;before she gets another chance at
Collier Pratt.&mdash;Creamed chicken and mushrooms.
It&rsquo;s a lucky thing that Gaspard diced
the chicken last night, and fixed that mac&eacute;doine
of vegetables for a garnish.&mdash;She&rsquo;s a
dangerous woman; she might wreck one&rsquo;s
whole life with her unfeeling, histrionic nonsense.&mdash;I
wonder if thirteen quarts of cream
sauce is going to be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out to be quite enough after the
crises in which the butter basis got too brown,
and the flour after melting into it smoothly
seemed unreasonably inclined to lump again as
Nancy stirred the cold milk into it, but the
result after all was perfectly adequate, except
for the uncanny brown tinge that the whole
mixture had taken on. Nancy was unable to
restrain herself from taking a sample of it to
Gaspard&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais</i>&mdash;but I can not eat it now,&rdquo; he cried,
misunderstanding the purpose of her visit, &ldquo;nor
again&mdash;nor ever again. <i>Jamais!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' ></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to eat it, Gaspard, I want
you to look at it, and tell me what makes it
that color. It turned tan, you see. I don&rsquo;t
want to poison any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too miserable,&rdquo; Gaspard said. &ldquo;The
sauce&mdash;you have made into B&eacute;chamel with the
browning butter, <i>voil&agrave; tout</i>. It is better so,&mdash;it
would not hurt any one in the world but me&mdash;and
me it would kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; sighed Nancy, as she took her
place by the kitchen dresser again, trying to
remember where she had last seen brown eyes
that reflected the look of stricken endurance
that glazed Gaspard&rsquo;s velvet orbs, recalled with
a start that Dick had gazed at her in much
the same helpless fashion on their drive home
from their recent motor trip in Connecticut.
She had been too absorbed in her own distresses
to consider anybody&rsquo;s state of mind but her
own, on that occasion, but now Dick&rsquo;s expression
came back to her vividly, and she nearly
ruined a big bowl of French dressing, at the
crucial moment of putting in the vinegar, trying
to imagine which one of the events of that
inauspicious day might conceivably have
caused it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' ></a>120</span></div>
<p>After the actual serving of the meal began,
however, she had very little time for reflection
or reminiscence. The distribution of food
to the waitresses as they called for it required
the full concentration of her powers. Molly and
Dolly coached her, and with their assistance
she was soon able to fill the bewilderingly
rapid orders from the line of girls stretching
from the door to the open space in front of her
serving-table, which never seemed to diminish
however adequately its demands were met.</p>
<p>Mechanically she took soup and meat dishes
from the hooded shelves at the top of the
range where they were kept warming, and
ladled out the brick-colored bisque, the creamed
chicken and garnishing of the individual
orders. The chicken looked delicious with its
accompaniment of vari-colored vegetables,&mdash;Nancy
had done away with the side dish long
since&mdash;and each serving was assembled with
special reference to its decorative qualities.
The girls went up-stairs to put the salad on
the plates, where the desserts were already
dished in the quaint blue bowls in which
stewed fruits and the more fluid sweets were
always served.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' ></a>121</span></div>
<p>In her mind&rsquo;s eye Nancy could see the picture.
At noon the court was almost entirely
in the shade, and instead of the awning top,
which shut out the air, there were gay striped
umbrellas at the one or two tables that were
imperfectly protected from the sun. She had
recently invested in some table-cloths with
bright blue woven borders. Flowers were arranged
in low bowls and baskets on respective
tables. Nancy instinctively grouped tired
young business men in blue serge and soft collars
at the tables decorated with the baskets of
blue flowers; and pale young women in lingerie
blouses before the bowls of roses. She could
see them,&mdash;those big-eyed girls with delicate
blue veins accentuating the pallor of their white
faces&mdash;sinking gratefully into the wicker seats
and benches, and sniffing rapturously at the
faint far-away fragrance of the woodland blossoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they will steal a great many of
them,&rdquo; she thought, for her patrons were given
to despoiling her flower vases in a way that
scandalized the good Hildeguard, who was a
just but ungenerous soul in spite of her ample
proportions and popular qualities. Molly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' ></a>122</span>
Dolly were rather given to encouraging the
vandals, knowing that they had Nancy&rsquo;s tacit
approval.</p>
<p>Automatically dipping the huge metal ladle&mdash;one
filling of which was enough for a service&mdash;into
the big soup kettle, she stood for a
moment gazing into its magenta depths oblivious
to everything but the rhapsodic consideration
of her realized dream. Now for the first
time she was contributing directly her own
strength and energy to the public which she
served. She had prepared with her own hands
the meal which her grateful patrons were consuming.
The little girls with the tired faces,
the jaded men, the smart, weary business women&mdash;buyers
and secretaries and modistes,&mdash;who
were occupied in the neighborhood were all
being literally nourished by her. She had actually
manufactured the product that was to
sustain them through the weary day of heat
and effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they like the lunch, Molly?&rdquo; she
asked, as she deftly deposited the forty-fifth
serving of chicken with B&eacute;chamel sauce on the
exact center of the plate before her. &ldquo;Are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' ></a>123</span>
they pleased with the soup? Are they saying
complimentary things about the chicken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them is, Miss Nancy. Some of
them is complaining that they can&rsquo;t get any
other kind of soup. Them that usually gets
invalid broth don&rsquo;t understand our running
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot about the specials,&rdquo; Nancy cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That red-haired girl that we feed on custards
and nut bread and that special cocoa
Gaspard makes for her, she acted real bad.
They get expecting certain things, and then
they want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make all those
things to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old feller that always has the stewed
prunes is terrible pleased though. I give him
two helps of the peaches, and he wanted
another. He was pleased to get white bread
too. He complains something dreadful about
his bran biscuit every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to send to the woman&rsquo;s exchange
for different kinds of health bread, but I forgot
it,&rdquo; Nancy moaned. &ldquo;Do they like the
peaches at all?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' ></a>124</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them likes them too well. There
was one old lady that got one whiff of them,
and pushed back her chair and left. I guess
she had took the pledge, and the brandy went
against her principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. I only thought
that brandied peaches would be a treat to so
many people who didn&rsquo;t have them habitually
served at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture in Nancy&rsquo;s mind changed in
color a trifle. She could see sour-faced spinsters
at single tables pushing back their
chairs, overturning the rose bowls in their
hurry to shake the dust of her restaurant
from their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t accept any money from people who
don&rsquo;t like their luncheon,&rdquo; she admonished
Molly, who was next in line with several
orders to be filled at once. &ldquo;Tell them that
the proprietor of Outside Inn prefers not to be
paid unless the meal is entirely satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there wouldn&rsquo;t never be any
satisfactory meals if I told them that, Miss
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any one ever to pay for anything
he doesn&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; Nancy insisted. &ldquo;Slip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' ></a>125</span>
the money back in their coat pockets if you
can&rsquo;t manage it any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of complaints about the soup,&rdquo;
Dolly said; &ldquo;so many people don&rsquo;t like tomato
in the heat. Gaspard, he always had a choice
even if it wasn&rsquo;t down on the menu. I might
deduct, say fifteen cents now, and slip it back
to them with their change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; Nancy implored. &ldquo;Tell Molly
and Hildeguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilda would drop dead, but Molly&rsquo;d like the
fun of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hot in the kitchen. The soup kettle
bad been emptied of more than half its contents,
but the liquid that was left bubbled
thickly over the gas flame that had been newly
lit to reheat it. The pungent, acrid odor of
hot tomatoes affronted her nostrils. She had
a vision now of the pale tired faces of the little
stenographers turning in disgust from the contemplation
of the flamboyant and sticky pur&eacute;e
on their plates, annoyed by the color scheme
in combination with the soft wild-rose pink
of the table bouquets, if not actually sickened
by the fluid itself. For the first time since
his abrupt seizure that morning she began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' ></a>126</span>
hope in her heart that Gaspard&rsquo;s illness might
be a matter of days instead of weeks. She
served Hildeguard and one of the other waitresses
with more soup, and then began to boil
some eggs to eke out the chicken, which, owing
to her unprecedented generosity in the matter
of portions, seemed to be diminishing with
alarming rapidity.</p>
<p>From the kitchen closet beyond came the
clatter of dishwashing, the interminable
splashing of water, and stacking of plates,
punctuated by the occasional clang of smashing
glass or pottery. She had discharged two
dishwashers in less than two weeks&rsquo; time,
with the natural feeling that any change in
that department must be for the better, but
the present incumbent was even more incompetent
than his predecessors. Even Nancy&rsquo;s
impregnable nerves began to feel the strain of
the continual clamorous assault on them.</p>
<p>Betty appeared in the doorway that led
directly from the restaurant stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to intrude,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
blame Michael, I&rsquo;m breaking my parole to get
in here. He locked me in and made me swear
I&rsquo;d keep out of the kitchen before he&rsquo;d let me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' ></a>127</span>
out at all, but I had to tell you this. The
tomato soup has curdled and you ought not to
serve it any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it looked rather funny,&rdquo;
Nancy moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do anybody any harm, you know.
It just looks bad, and a lot of people are kicking
about it. Did Molly tell you about the
old fellow that got tipsy on the peaches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t. I sent Michael out for some
ripe peaches and other fruit to serve instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea. How&rsquo;s the food holding
out? There are lots of people you know up-stairs,&rdquo;
she rattled on, for Nancy, who was
getting more and more distraught with each
disquieting detail, made no pretense of answering
her. &ldquo;Dolly has probably kept you
informed. Dick&rsquo;s aunt is here, and that terribly
highbrow cousin of Caroline&rsquo;s; and that
good-looking young surgeon that suddenly got
so famous last winter, and admired you so
much. Dr. Sunderland&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that his name?
I never saw Collier Pratt here for lunch before.
There&rsquo;s a little girl with him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collier Pratt?&rdquo; Nancy cried, &ldquo;Oh, Betty,
he isn&rsquo;t here. He couldn&rsquo;t be. Don&rsquo;t frighten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' ></a>128</span>
me with any such nonsense. He never comes
here in the day-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is though,&rdquo; Betty said, &ldquo;and a queer-looking
little child with him, a dark-eyed
little thing dressed in black satin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a good deal to me as if you were
making that up,&rdquo; Nancy cried in exasperation;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s so much the kind of thing you do
make up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Betty said, unexpectedly
reasonable, &ldquo;but as it happens I&rsquo;m not. Collier
Pratt really is up-stairs with a poor little
orphan in tow. Ask any one of the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Dolly, her ribbons awry and
her china-blue eyes widened with excitement,
appeared with a dramatic confirmation of
Betty&rsquo;s astonishing announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little girl took sick from the
peaches, and moved up-stairs in the room
next to Gaspard&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she cried breathlessly.
&ldquo;The doctor that was sitting at the next
table, had her moved right up there. He
wants to see the lady that runs the restaurant,
and he wants a lot of hot water in a pitcher,
and some baking soda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Betty said, &ldquo;go on up, I&rsquo;ll take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' ></a>129</span>
your place here. Dolly, get the things the
doctor asked for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy stripped off her cap and her apron
and resigned her spoons and ladles to Betty
without a word. She was still incredulous of
what she would find at the top of the three
flights of creaking age-worn stairs that
separated her from the nest of rooms that
were the storm quarters of her hostelry, now
converted by a sudden malevolence on the part
of fate into a temporary hospital. As she
took the last flight she could hear Gaspard&rsquo;s
stertorous breathing coming at the regular intervals
of distressful slumber, and through
that an ominous murmur of grave and low-voiced
conference, such as one hears in the
chambers of the dead. The convulsive application
of a powder puff to the tip of her burning
nose&mdash;her whole face was aflame with
exertion and excitement&mdash;was merely a part
of her whole subconscious effort to get herself
in hand for the exigency. Her mind, itself, refused
any preparation for the scene that
awaited her.</p>
<p>On one of the cushioned benches against the
wall in the most decorative of the dining-rooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' ></a>130</span>
of the up-stairs suite, a little girl was
lying stark against the brilliant blue of the
upholstery. She was a child of some seven or
eight, lightly built and delicate of features and
dressed all in black. Her eyes were closed,
but the long lashes emphasizing the shadows in
which they were set, prepared you for the
revelation of them. Nancy understood that
they were Collier Pratt&rsquo;s eyes, and that they
would open presently, and look wonderingly
up at her. She recognized the presence of Dr.
Sunderland, of Michael and several of the
waitresses, and a flighty woman in blue taffeta&mdash;an
ubiquitous patron,&mdash;but she made
her way past them at once, and sank on her
knees before the prostrate child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing very serious, Miss Martin,&rdquo;
the young surgeon reassured her, &ldquo;delicate
children of this type are likely to have these
seizures. It&rsquo;s not exactly a fainting fit. It
belongs rather to the family of hysteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the peaches?&rdquo; Nancy asked
fearfully. &ldquo;They&mdash;they had a little brandy in
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may have been a contributing cause,&rdquo;
Dr. Sunderland acknowledged, &ldquo;but the child&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' ></a>131</span>
condition is primarily responsible. Let her
alone until she rouses,&mdash;then give her hot
water with a pinch of soda in it at fifteen-minute
intervals. Keep her feet hot and her
head cold and don&rsquo;t try to move her until
after dark, when it&rsquo;s cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes her poor father, now,&rdquo; the
lady in taffeta announced with the dramatic
commiseration of the self-invited auditor.
&ldquo;He thought an iced towel on her head might
make her feel better. Is the dear little thing
an orphan&mdash;I mean a half orphan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembled company seeming disinclined
to respond, she repeated her inquiry to Collier
Pratt himself, as with the susceptive grace
that characterized all his movements, he
swung the compress he was carrying sharply
to and fro to preserve its temperature in
transit. &ldquo;Is the poor little thing a half orphan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor little thing is nine-tenths orphan,
madam,&rdquo; said Collier Pratt, &ldquo;that is&mdash;the only
creature to whom she can turn for protection is
the apology for a parent that you see before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' ></a>132</span>
you. Would you mind stepping aside and giving
me a little more room to work in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Irony was wasted on the indomitable
sympathizer in blue. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she really
anybody but you to take care of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collier Pratt arranged the towel precisely in
position over the little girl&rsquo;s forehead, smoothing
with careful fingers the cloud of dusky hair
that fell about her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not,&rdquo; he answered with some savagery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she any women friends or relatives
that would be willing to take charge of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then some woman that has no child of her
own to care for ought to adopt her, and relieve
you of the responsibility. It&rsquo;s a shame and disgrace
the way these New York women with no
natural ties of their own go around crying for
something to do, when there are sweet little
children like this suffering for a mother&rsquo;s care.
I&rsquo;d adopt her myself if I was able to. I certainly
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to give over the technical
part of her bringing up to some one of the
women whom you so feelingly describe,&rdquo; Collier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' ></a>133</span>
Pratt said. &ldquo;The trouble is to find the woman&mdash;the
right woman. The vicarious mother is
not the most prevalent of our modern types,
I regret to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl on the couch stirred softly, and
the hand that Nancy was holding, a pathetic,
thin, unkempt little hand, grew warm in hers.
The lids of the big eyes fluttered and lifted.
Nancy looked into their clouded depths for an
instant. Then she turned to Collier Pratt
decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of your little girl for you, if
you will let me,&rdquo; she said.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_IX_SHEILA'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Sheila</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;I had <i>mal de mer</i> when I was on the
steamer,&rdquo; the child said, in her pretty,
painstaking English&mdash;she spoke French habitually.
&ldquo;I do not like to have it on the land.
The gentleman in there,&rdquo; she pointed to the
room beyond where Gaspard was again distressfully
sleeping the sleep of the spent after a period
of the most profound physical agitation,
&ldquo;he does not like to have it, too,&mdash;I mean
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy had propped the little girl up on
improvised pillows made of coats and wraps
swathed in towels and covered her with some
strips of canton flannel designed to use as
&ldquo;hushers&rdquo; under the table covers. As soon as
the intense discomfort and nausea that had followed
the first period of faintness had passed,
Nancy had slipped off the shabby satin dress,
made like the long-sleeved kitchen apron of
New England extraction, and attired the child
in a craftily simulated night-gown of table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' ></a>135</span>
linen. Collier Pratt had worked with her,
deftly supplementing all her efforts for his
little girl&rsquo;s comfort until she had fallen into the
exhausted sleep from which she was only now
rousing and beginning to chatter. Her father
had left her, still sleeping soundly, in Nancy&rsquo;s
care, and gone off to keep an appointment with
a prospective picture buyer. He had made no
comment on Nancy&rsquo;s sudden impulsive offer to
take the child in charge, and neither she nor he
had referred to the matter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you comfortable now, Sheila?&rdquo; Nancy
asked. She had expected the child to have a
French name, Suzanne or Japonette or something
equally picturesque, but she realized as
soon as she heard it that Sheila was much more
suitable. The cloudy blue-black hair, and steel-blue
eyes, the slight elongation of the space
between the upper lip and nose, the dazzling
satin whiteness of the skin were all Irish in
their suggestion. Was the child&rsquo;s mother&mdash;that
other natural protector of the child, who had
died or deserted her&mdash;Nancy tried not to wonder
too much which it was that she had done,&mdash;an
Irish girl, or was Collier Pratt himself of
that romantic origin?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' ></a>136</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, Mademoiselle, I mean, yes, thank you.
I do not think I will say to you Miss Martin.
We only say their names like that to the people
with whom we are not <i>intime</i>. We are <i>intime</i>
now, aren&rsquo;t we, now that I have been so very
sick <i>chez vous</i>? In Paris the <i>concierge</i> had a
daughter that I called Mademoiselle Cherie, and
we were <i>very intime</i>. I think I would like to
call you Miss Dear in English after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like that very much,&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad the sick gentleman is called Gaspard.
So many <i>messieurs</i>&mdash;I mean gentlemen
in Paris are called Gaspard, and hardly any in
the United States of America. American things
are very different from things in Paris, don&rsquo;t
you think so, Miss Dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they are,&rdquo; Nancy acquiesced
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they are too,&rdquo; the child said,
&ldquo;but afraid is what I try not to be of them. My
father says America is full of beasts and devils,
but he does not mind because he can paint
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live in a studio?&rdquo; Nancy asked
after a struggle to prevent herself from asking
the question. She felt that she had no right to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' ></a>137</span>
any of the facts about Collier Pratt&rsquo;s existence
that he did not choose to volunteer for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Dear, but not like Paris. There
we had a door that opened into a garden, and
the birds sang there, and I was allowed to go
and play. Here we have only a fire-escape,
and the <i>concierge</i> is only a janitor and
will not allow us to keep milk bottles on it. I
do not like a janitor. <i>Concierges</i> have so much
more <i>politesse</i>. Now, no one takes care of me
when father goes out, or brings me soup or
<i>g&acirc;teaux</i> when he forgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he forget?&rdquo; Nancy cried, horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. He forgets himself, too, very
often except dinner. He remembers that because
he likes to come to this Outside Inn restaurant,
where the cooking is so good. He
brought me here to-day because it was my birthday.
I think the cooking is very good except
that I was so sick of eating it, but father swore
to-day that it was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said damn. That is not very bad swearing.
I think <i>nom de Dieu</i> is worse, don&rsquo;t you,
Miss Dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you up in my arms,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' ></a>138</span>
Nancy with sudden passion. &ldquo;I want to feel how
thin you are, and I want to feel how you&mdash;feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your eyes are wetting,&rdquo; the little girl
exclaimed as she nestled contentedly against
Nancy&rsquo;s breast, where Nancy had gathered her,
converted table-cloth and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your not having enough to eat,&rdquo; Nancy
cried. &ldquo;Oh! baby child, honey. How could
they? It&rsquo;s your calling me Miss Dear, too,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand the combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child patted her cheek consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my father cries because
I get so hungry, when he forgets, but he
does forget again as soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to come and live with me,
Sheila?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall,&rdquo; Nancy said devoutly.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt found his child in Nancy&rsquo;s arms
when he again mounted the stairs to the third
floor of Outside Inn. The place was curiously
cool to one who had been walking the sun-baked
streets, and he gave an appreciative glance at
the dim interior and the tableau of woman and
child. Nancy&rsquo;s burnished head bent gravely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' ></a>139</span>
over the shadowy dark one resting against her
bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right again, is she?&rdquo; he inquired with
the slow rare smile that Nancy had not seen
before that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s better. She&rsquo;s under-nourished,
that&rsquo;s what the trouble is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected that,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said ruefully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not specially talented as a parent.
I feed her passionately for days, and then I
stop feeding her almost entirely. Artists in my
circumstances eat sketchily at best. The only
reason that I am fed with any regularity is that
I have the habit of coming to this restaurant
of yours. By the way, is it yours? I found you
in charge to-day to my amazement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in charge to-day,&rdquo; Nancy acknowledged;
&ldquo;in fact I have taken over the management
of it for&mdash;for a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious philanthropist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will refrain from any comment on
the lunch to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&mdash;that was a mistake,&rdquo; Nancy
cried, &ldquo;an experiment. Gaspard the <i>chef</i>&mdash;was
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' ></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He was very ill, father, dear,&rdquo; Sheila added
gravely, &ldquo;like crossing the Channel, much sicker
than I was. I was only sick like crossing the
ocean, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fine distinctions,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s much given to them.&rdquo; His eyes narrowed
as they rested again on the picture
Nancy made&mdash;the cool curve of her bent neck,
the rise and fall of the breast in which the
breathing had quickened perceptibly since his
coming,&mdash;the child swathed in the long folds of
white linen outlined against the Madonna blue
of the dress that she was wearing. Nancy
blushed under the intentness of his gaze, understanding,
thanks to Caroline&rsquo;s report of his
conversation with Betty, something of what
was in his mind about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaspard is going to be taken away in an ambulance,&rdquo;
the child said, &ldquo;to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who is going to cook my dinner?&rdquo;
Collier Pratt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lord, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nancy cried,
roused to her responsibilities.</p>
<p>She looked at the watch on her wrist, a platinum
bracelet affair with an octagonal face that
Dick had persuaded her to accept for a Christmas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' ></a>141</span>
present by giving one exactly like it to
Betty and Caroline. It was twenty-five minutes
of five. Dinner was served every night
promptly at half past six, and there was absolutely
no preparation made for it, not so much
as a loaf of bread ordered. Instead of doing
the usual marketing in the morning she had
sent Michael out for the things that she needed
in the preparation of luncheon, and planned to
make up a list of things that she needed for
dinner just as soon as her midday duties in the
kitchen had set her free. She thought that she
would be more like Gaspard, &ldquo;inspired to buy
what is right&rdquo; if she waited until the success
of her luncheon had been assured. The ensuing
events had driven the affairs of her cuisine
entirely out of her mind. She was constrained
by her native tendency to concentrate on the
business in hand to the exclusion of all other
matters, big and little. She had dismissed
Betty during the excitement that followed Sheila&rsquo;s
illness, and Betty had seemed unnaturally
willing to leave the hectic scene and go about
her business. Michael had made several ineffectual
attempts to speak to her, but she had
waved him away impatiently. She knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' ></a>142</span>
neither he nor any one else on the restaurant
staff would believe that she hadn&rsquo;t made some
adequate and mysterious provision for the serving
of the night meal. She had never failed
before in the smallest detail of executive policy.
She set the child back upon the cushion, and
arranged her perfunctorily in position there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> you are going to have
for dinner,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;much less who&rsquo;s going
to cook it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better arrange to have it
elsewhere, since this seems to be literally the
cook&rsquo;s day out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be dinner,&rdquo; said Nancy uncertainly.</p>
<p>Dick came up the stairs three at a time, and
in his wake she heard the murmur of women&rsquo;s
voices&mdash;Caroline&rsquo;s and Betty&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you were in difficulties,&rdquo; Dick said,
&ldquo;so I made Sister Betty and Caroline give up
their perfectly good trip into the country, in
order to come around and mix in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Betty was going driving with
you,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say so. Oh!
Dick, there isn&rsquo;t any dinner. I forgot all about
it. This is Mr. Collier Pratt and his little
daughter,&mdash;Mr. Richard Thorndyke. She&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' ></a>143</span>
coming to live with me soon, I hope, and let
Hitty take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;that paragraph
is replete with interest, but I want to
get it assimilated. Sure, Betty was going driving
with me. I told her to ask you if she
thought it would be any use, but she allowed
it wouldn&rsquo;t. I am delighted to meet Mr. Pratt,
and pleased to know that his daughter is coming
to live with you, but isn&rsquo;t that rather sudden?
Also, what&rsquo;s this about there not being
any dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy was beginning, when
she realized that Caroline and Betty, who had
followed closely on Dick&rsquo;s footsteps, were looking
at her with faces pale with consternation
and alarm. She could see the anticipatory collapse
of Outside Inn writ large on Caroline&rsquo;s
expressive countenance. Caroline was the type
of girl who believed that in the very nature of
things the undertakings of her most intimate
friends were doomed to failure. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
any dinner yet,&rdquo; Nancy corrected herself, &ldquo;but
you go up to my place, Dick, and get Hitty.
Tell her she&rsquo;s got to cook dinner for this restaurant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' ></a>144</span>
to-night. She can cook three courses
of anything she likes, and have <i>carte blanche</i>
in the kitchen. You have more influence with
her than anybody, so, no matter what she says,
make her do it. Then when she decides what
she wants to cook, drive her around until she
collects her ingredients. She won&rsquo;t let anybody
do the marketing for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do more than that,&rdquo; Betty
laughed as he started off, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re perfectly
capable of it. How do you do, Mr. Pratt? This
is Miss Eustace, pale with apprehension about
the way things are going, but still recognizable
and answering to her name.&rdquo; Betty always enjoyed
introducing Caroline with an audacious
flourish, since Caroline always suffered so much
in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is little Miss Sheila Pratt,&rdquo; Nancy
supplemented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Enchant&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; the little girl said, &ldquo;I mean, I
am very pleased to meet you. I was very sick,
but I am better now, and I am going to live
with Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to be settled,&rdquo; her father said,
shrugging.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' ></a>145</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind it so very much?&rdquo; Nancy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it at all,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said.
&ldquo;I think it would be a delightful arrangement,&mdash;if
I&rsquo;m to take you seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy is always to be taken seriously,&rdquo;
Betty put in. &ldquo;What she really wants of the
child is to use her for dietetic experiment, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s used to, poor child,&rdquo; Collier
Pratt said ruefully.</p>
<p>The removal of Gaspard created a diversion.
Nancy took Sheila in to bid him good-by, and
the great creature was so touched by the farewell
kiss that she imprinted on his forehead,
and the revelation of the fact that a fellow being
had been suffering kindred throes in the
chamber just beyond his own that he was of
two minds about letting himself be moved at
all from her proximity. A group of waitresses
collected on the second landing, and Nancy and
her friends stood together at the head of the
stairs while the white-coated intern from the
hospital rolled his great bulk upon a fragile-looking
stretcher, and with the assistance of all
the male talent in the establishment, managed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' ></a>146</span>
to head him down the stairs, and so on across
the court and into the waiting ambulance.</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s eyes filled with inexplicable tears,
and she caught Collier Pratt regarding them
with some amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a dear,&rdquo; she said somewhat irrelevantly.
&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t care whether he was
sick or not this morning,&mdash;but you get so fond
of people that are around all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Collier Pratt,&mdash;he spoke very
lightly, but there was something in his tone
that made Nancy want to turn and look at him
intently. She seemed to see for the first time a
shade of defiant cruelty in his face,&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
he reiterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Nancy repeated stubbornly, but as she
met his slow smile, the slight impression of unpleasantness
vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We artists are selfish people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to run away now, and leave my daughter
to cultivate your charming friends. Will you
come and eat your dinner at my little table to-night,
and talk, discuss this matter of her visit
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if there is any dinner,&rdquo; Nancy said,
putting out a throbbing hand to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' ></a>147</span></div>
<p>There was a dinner. It was Hitty&rsquo;s conception
of an emergency meal&mdash;the kind of thing
that her mother before her had prepared on
wash-day when an unexpected relative alighted
from the noon train, and surprised her into inadvertent
hospitality. It began with steamed
clams and melted butter sauce. Hitty knew a
fish market where the clams were imported direct
from Cape Cod by the nephew of a man
who used to go to school with her husband&rsquo;s
brother, and he warranted every clam she
bought of him. They were served in soup
plates and the drawn butter in demi-tasses, but
Hitty would have it no other way. The <i>pi&egrave;ce
de r&eacute;sistance</i> was ham and eggs, great fragrant
crispy slices of ham browned faintly gold across
their pinky surface, and eggs&mdash;Hitty knew
where to get country eggs, too&mdash;so white, so
golden-yolked, so tempting that it was difficult
to associate them with the prosaic process
of frying, but fried they were. With them were
served boiled potatoes in their jackets,&mdash;no
wash-day cook ever removed the peeling from
an emergency potato,&mdash;and afterward a course
of Hitty&rsquo;s famous huckleberry dumplings, the
lightest, most ephemeral balls of dumplings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' ></a>148</span>
that were ever dipped into the blue-black deeps
of hot huckleberry&mdash;not blueberry, but country
huckleberry&mdash;sauce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the coffee?&rdquo; Nancy asked Dolly
miserably, when the humiliating meal was
drawing to its close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t make coffee,&rdquo; Dolly whispered;
&ldquo;she says it will keep everybody awake, and
they&rsquo;re much better off without it, but Miss
Betty, she&rsquo;s watching her chance, and she&rsquo;s
making it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collier Pratt had received each course in silence,
but had eaten heartily of the food that
was set before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he was hungry enough to eat
anything,&rdquo; Nancy thought; &ldquo;the lunch was humiliating
enough, but this surpasses anything
I dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had given up trying to estimate the calories
that each man was likely to average in partaking
of Hitty&rsquo;s menu. She noticed that a
great many of her patrons had taken second
helpings, and that threw her out in her calculation
of quantities, while the relative digestibility
of the protein and the fats in pork depend
so much upon its preparation that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' ></a>149</span>
could not approximate the virtue of Hitty&rsquo;s bill
of fare without consultation with Hitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very excellent dinner,&rdquo; Collier
Pratt broke through her painful reverie to make
his pronouncement. &ldquo;Astonishing, but very
satisfactory. It reminds me of days on my
grandfather&rsquo;s farm when I was a youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it might,&rdquo; Nancy said, for
the first time in her relation with her new
friend becoming ironical on her own account.
Then she added seriously, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hitty, you know,
that will have all the real care of Sheila. I&rsquo;m
pretty busy down here, and I&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated,
half expecting him to threaten to remove his
child at once from the prospective guardianship
of a creature who reverted so readily to
the barbarism of ham and eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s Hitty that is to have the care
of Sheila,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said, and Nancy was
not longer puzzled as to which element of her
parentage Sheila owed her Irish complexion,
&ldquo;why, more power to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy dreamed that night that she was married
to Dick, and that Hitty made and served
them <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foies gras</i> dumplings, while Collier
Pratt in freckles and overalls sat in a high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' ></a>150</span>
chair, and had his dinner with the family.
Later it was discovered that Betty had poisoned
his bread and milk, and he died in Nancy&rsquo;s arms
in dreadful agony, swearing in a beautiful Irish
brogue that in all his life he had never looked
at another woman,&mdash;which even in her dream
seemed to Nancy a somewhat irreconcilable
statement.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_X_THE_PORTRAIT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>The Portrait</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>To Nancy&rsquo;s surprise Hitty welcomed the little
girl warmly, when she was introduced
into the family circle. She liked to be busy all
day, and her duties in taking care of Nancy
were not onerous enough to keep her full energy
employed. She liked children and family life,
and she seemed to have the feeling that if
Nancy continued to assemble the various parts
that go to make up a family, she would end by
adding to it the essential masculine element,
though it was Dick and not Collier Pratt that
she visualized at the head of the table cutting
up Sheila&rsquo;s meat for her. Collier Pratt
was to her a necessary but insignificant detail
in Nancy&rsquo;s scheme of things, a poor artist who
had &ldquo;frittered away so much time in furrin
parts&rdquo; that he was incapable of supporting his
only child&mdash;&ldquo;poor little motherless lamb!&rdquo;&mdash;in
anything like a befitting and adequate manner.
Whenever he came to see Sheila she treated him
with the condescension of a poor relation, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' ></a>152</span>
served his tea in the second best china with the
kitchen silver and linen, unless Nancy caught
her at it in time to demand the best.</p>
<p>Nancy had expected that Collier Pratt would
try to make some business arrangement with
her when she took Sheila in charge,&mdash;that he
would insist on paying her at least a nominal
sum a week for the child&rsquo;s board. She had
lain awake nights planning the conversations
with him in which she would overcome his delicate
but natural scruples in the matter and persuade
him to her own way of thinking. She had
even fixed on the smallest sum&mdash;two dollars and
a half a week&mdash;at which she thought she might
induce him to compromise, if all her eloquence
failed. She knew that he considered her the
hard working, paid manager of Outside Inn,
and took it for granted that she had no other
source of income. She was a little disconcerted
that he made no effort, beyond thanking her
sincerely and simply for her kindness, to put
the matter on a more concrete basis, but when
he told her presently that he was going to do a
portrait of her, she scourged herself for her
New England perspective on an affair that he
handled with so much delicacy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' ></a>153</span></div>
<p>Her friends were, on the whole, pleased with
her experiment in vicarious motherhood. Dick
instinctively resented the fact that Nancy had
taken Collier Pratt&rsquo;s daughter into her home
and heart, but the child herself was a delight
to him, and he spent hours romping with her
and telling her stories, loading her with toys
and sweetmeats, and taking her off for enchanting
holiday excursions &ldquo;over the Palisades and
far away.&rdquo; Billy was hardly less diverted with
her, and Betty regarded her advent as a provision
on the part of Providence against things
becoming too commonplace. Caroline, as was
her wont, took the child very seriously, and
tried to interest Nancy in all the latest educational
theories for her development, including
posture dancing, and potato raising.</p>
<p>Nancy herself had loved the child from the
moment the big lustrous gray eyes opened, on
the day of her sudden illness at Outside Inn,
and looked confidingly up into hers. For the
first time in her life her maternal ardor&mdash;the
instinct which made her yearn to nourish and
minister to a race&mdash;had concentrated on a single
human being. Sheila, hungry for mothering,
had turned to her with the simplicity of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' ></a>154</span>
people among whom she had been brought up,
taking her sympathetic response as a matter of
course; and the two were soon on the closest,
most affectionate terms.</p>
<p>Sheila and Outside Inn divided Nancy&rsquo;s time
to the practical exclusion of all other interests.
She had, without realizing her processes, taken
into her life artificial responsibilities in almost
exact proportion to the normal ones of any
woman who makes the choice of marriage
rather than that of a career. She was doing
housekeeping on a large scale,&mdash;she had a child
to care for, and she felt that she had entirely
disproved any lingering feeling in the mind of
any one associated with her that she ought to
marry,&mdash;at least that she ought to marry Dick.</p>
<p>No woman ought to marry for the sake of
marrying, but she was growing to understand
now that the experiences of love and marriage
might be necessary to the true development of
a woman like herself; that there might even be
some tragedy in missing them. She was twenty-five,
practically alone in the world, and the
growing passion of her life was for a child
that she had borrowed, and might be constrained
to relinquish at any moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' ></a>155</span></div>
<p>She was tired. The unaccustomed confinement
of the long hours at the Inn, the strain of
enduring the thick, almost unalleviated heat of
an exceptionally humid New York summer, and
the tension engendered by her various executive
responsibilities, all told on her physically,
and her physical condition in its turn reacted
on her mind, till she was conscious of a
nostalgia,&mdash;a yearning and a hunger for something
that she could not understand or name,
but that was none the less irresistible. She fell
into strange moods of brooding and lassitude;
but there were two connections in which her
spirit and ambition never failed her. She
never failed of interest in the distribution of
food values to her unconscious patrons, and incidentally
to Collier Pratt, or in directing the
activities and diversions of Sheila.</p>
<p>She bathed and dressed the child with her
own hands every morning, combed out the
cloudy black hair, fine spun and wavy, that
framed the delicate face, and accentuated the
dazzling white and pink of her coloring. She
had bought her a complete new wardrobe&mdash;she
was spending money freely now on every one
but herself&mdash;venturing on one dress at a time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' ></a>156</span>
in fear and trepidation lest Collier Pratt should
suddenly call her to account for her interference
with his rights as a parent, but he seemed
entirely oblivious of the fact that Sheila had
changed her shabby studio black for the most
cobwebby of muslins and linens, frocks that by
virtue of their exquisite fineness cost Nancy
considerably more than her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say to my father, &lsquo;See the pretty new gown
that Miss Dear bought for me,&rsquo; and my father
says to me, &lsquo;Comb your hair straight back from
your brow, and don&rsquo;t let your arms dangle from
your shoulders.&rsquo;&rdquo; Sheila complained, &ldquo;He sees
so hard the little things that nobody sees&mdash;and
big things like a dress or a hat he does not
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are like that,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;Last night
when I put on my new rose-colored gown for
the first time, your friend Monsieur Dick told
me he had always liked that dress best of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Comme il est dr&ocirc;le</i>, Monsieur Dick,&rdquo; Sheila
said; &ldquo;he asked me to grow up and marry him
some day. He said I should sit on a cushion
and sew a fine seam, and feast upon strawberries,
sugar and cream&mdash;like the poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' ></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I said that I thought I should like to marry
him if I ever got to be big enough,&mdash;but I was
afraid I should not be bigger for a long time.
Miss Betty said she would marry him if I was
<i>trop petite</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Dick say to that?&rdquo; Nancy could
not forbear asking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said she was very kind, and maybe the
time might come when he would think seriously
of her offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a feeling in Nancy&rsquo;s breast as if
her heart had suddenly got up and sat down
again. Betty bore no remotest resemblance to
the pale kind girl, practically devoid of feminine
allure, that Nancy had visualized as the
mate for Dick, and frequently exhorted him to
go in search of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty was only making a joke,&rdquo; she
told Sheila sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were all making jokes, Miss Dear,&rdquo;
Sheila explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never loved any one in the world
quite so much as I love you, Sheila,&rdquo; Nancy
cried in sudden passion as the little girl turned
her face up to be kissed, as she always did when
the conversation puzzled her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' ></a>158</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I like being loved,&rdquo; Sheila said, sighing happily.
&ldquo;My father loves me,&mdash;when he is not
painting or eating. He is very good to me, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is a very wise man, Sheila,&rdquo;
Nancy said, &ldquo;he understands beautiful things
that other people don&rsquo;t know anything about.
He looks at a flower and knows all about it, and&mdash;and
what it needs to make it flourish. He
looks at people that way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t always have time to get the
flower what it wants,&rdquo; Sheila said; &ldquo;my jessamine
died in Paris because he forgot to water
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father needs taking care of himself,
Sheila. We must plan ways of trying to make
him more comfortable. Don&rsquo;t you think of
something that he needs that we could get for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More socks&mdash;he would like,&rdquo; Sheila said unexpectedly.
&ldquo;When his socks get holes in them
he will not wear them. He stops whatever he
is doing to mend them, and the mends hurt him.
He mends my stockings, too, sometimes, but I
like better the holes especially when he mends
them on my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' ></a>159</span></div>
<p>Sheila could have presented no more appealing
picture of her father to Nancy&rsquo;s vivid
imagination. Collier Pratt with the incongruous
sewing equipment of the unaccustomed
male, using, more than likely, black darning
cotton on a white sock&mdash;Nancy&rsquo;s mental pictures
were always full of the most realistic detail&mdash;bent
tediously over a child&rsquo;s stocking,
while the precious sunlight was streaming unheeded
upon the waiting canvas. She darned
very badly herself, but the desire was not less
strong in her to take from him all these preposterous
and unbefitting tasks, and execute them
with her own hands. She stared at the child
fixedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You buy him some socks out of your allowance,&rdquo;
she said at last. Then she added an anxious
and inadequate &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you happy?&rdquo; Sheila asked in unconscious
imitation of Dick, with whom she had
been spending most of her time for days, while
Nancy superintended the additions and improvements
she was making in the up-stairs
quarters of her Inn, preparatory to moving in
for the winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m happy,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' ></a>160</span>
of&mdash;stirred, too. I wish you were my own little
girl, Sheila. I think I&rsquo;ll take you with me to
the Inn to-day. You might melt and trickle
away if I left you alone here with Hitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quelle joie!</i> I mean, how nice that will be!
Then I can talk about Paris to Gaspard, and he
will give me some baba, with a <i>soup&ccedil;on of maraschine</i> in the sauce, if you will tell him that I
may, Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo; It was Nancy&rsquo;s dearest
privilege to be asked and grant permission for
such indulgences. &ldquo;Put on that floppy white
hat with the yellow ribbon, and take your white
coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had only one dress to wear I suppose
I got just as dirty,&rdquo; Sheila reflected, &ldquo;only
it didn&rsquo;t show on black satin. Now I can tell
just how dirty I am by looking. I make lots of
washing, Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank heaven,&rdquo; Nancy said, unaccountably
tearful of a sudden.</p>
<p>The first part of the day at the Inn went much
like other days. Gaspard, eager to retrieve
the record of the week when Hitty and a Viennese
pastry cook had divided the honors of preparing
the daily menus between them&mdash;for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' ></a>161</span>
Nancy had never again attempted the feat&mdash;never
let a day go by without making a new
<i>plat de jour</i> or inventing a sauce; was in the
throes of composing a new casserole, and it was
a pleasure to watch him deftly sifting and sorting
his ingredients, his artist&rsquo;s eyes aglow with
the inward fire of inspiration. Nancy called all
the waitresses together and offered them certain
prizes and rewards for all the buttermilk,
and prunes and other health dishes that they
were able to distribute among ailing patrons,&mdash;with
the result they were over assiduous at the
luncheon hour, and a red-headed young man
with gold teeth made a disturbance that it took
both Hilda and Michael, who appeared suddenly
in his overalls from the upper regions where
he was constructing window-boxes, to quell.
But these incidents were not sufficiently significant
to make the day in any way a memorable
one to Nancy. It took a telephone message
from Collier Pratt, requesting, nay demanding,
her presence in his studio for the first sitting
on her portrait, to make the day stand out
upon her calendar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheila is with me. Shall I bring her?&rdquo;
Nancy asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' ></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said uncompromisingly,
&ldquo;I am not a parent at this hour. She would
disturb me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That blue cr&ecirc;pe, made surplice,&mdash;the one
you liked the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I want&mdash;Madonna blue.
Can you get down here in fifteen minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll send Michael up-town with Sheila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bare, ramshackle studio on Washington
Square shocked her,&mdash;it was so comfortless, so
dingy; but the canvases on the walls, set up
against the wainscoting, stacked on every
available chair, gave her a new and almost appalling
impression of his personality, and the
peculiar poignant power of him. She could not
appraise them, or get any real sense of their
quality apart from the astounding revelation of
the man behind the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo; she gasped, but
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful&rdquo; were the words she stifled
on her lips.</p>
<p>He painted till the light failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this diffused glow,&mdash;this gentle, faded
afternoon light that I want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' ></a>163</span>
you to emerge from your background as if you
had bloomed out of it that very moment. Oh!
I&rsquo;ve got you at your hour, you know! The
prescient maternal&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I want. The
conscious moment when a woman becomes
aware that she is potentially a mother. Sheila&rsquo;s
done that for you. She&rsquo;s brought it out in you.
It was ready, it was waiting there before, but
now it&rsquo;s come. It&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been done, you know. It&rsquo;s a modern
conception, of course; but they all do the
thing realized, or incipient. I want to do it
<i>implicit</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I want. I might have
searched the whole world over and not found
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here I am,&rdquo; said Nancy faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here you are,&rdquo; Collier Pratt responded
out of the fervor of his artist&rsquo;s absorption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a personal matter to me,&rdquo; Nancy
ventured some seconds later.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt turned from the canvas he was
contemplating, and looked at her, still posed as
he had placed her, upright, yet relaxed in the
scooped chair that held her without constraining
her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' ></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Like a flower in a vase,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;to me
you&rsquo;re a wonderful creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like me,&rdquo; Nancy said, quivering
a little. &ldquo;This is a rather uncommon experience
to me, you know, being looked at so
impersonally. Now please don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m
being American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good God! I don&rsquo;t look at you impersonally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Nancy meant her voice to be
light, and she was appalled to hear the quaver
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He glanced toward a
dun-colored curtain evidently concealing shelves
and dishes. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay for tea.&rdquo; Nancy felt her lips
begin to quiver childishly, but she could not
control their trembling. &ldquo;Oh! I had better go,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt took one step toward her. Then
he turned toward the canvas. Nancy read his
mind like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll disturb the&mdash;what you
want to paint,&rdquo; she said accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;  He smiled his sweet slow smile, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' ></a>165</span>
he took her stiff interlaced hands and raised
them, still locked together, to his lips where
he kissed them gently, one after the other.
&ldquo;Will you forgive me?&rdquo; he asked, and pushed
her gently outside of his studio door.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Billy and Caroline</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>It was one night in middle October when Billy
and Caroline met by accident on Thirty-fourth
Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
Caroline stood looking into a drug-store
window where an automatic mannikin was
shaving himself with a patent safety razor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wax feller going to bed in an automatic
folding settee, a little farther down the
street,&rdquo; Billy offered gravely at her elbow; &ldquo;and
on Forty-second Street there is a real live duck
pond advertising the advantages of electric
heaters in the home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;lo,&rdquo; said Caroline, who was colloquial
only in moments of real pleasure or excitement.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just written to you. I asked you to come
and see me to-morrow evening,&rdquo; she added more
seriously, &ldquo;to talk about something that&rsquo;s
weighing on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out with a blonde to-morrow,
night,&rdquo; Billy said speciously, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the
matter with to-night? I&rsquo;m free until six-fifty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' ></a>167</span>
A. M. and I could spare an hour or two between
then and breakfast time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t to-night,&rdquo; Caroline said, &ldquo;I promised
Nancy to dine at the Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t your line at all,&rdquo; Billy groaned.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the blonde?&mdash;that was your cue. If
it&rsquo;s only Nancy you&rsquo;re dining with&mdash;that can be
fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regard an engagement with Nancy as just
as sacred as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Billy cut in. &ldquo;She is the blonde.
Well, let to-morrow night be as it may; let&rsquo;s
you and I call up the Nancy girl now and tell
her that we&rsquo;re going batting together; she
won&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like doing that,&rdquo; Caroline said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a nice night for a bat, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked down Murray Hill and saw the sun
set in a nice pinky gold setting,&rdquo; Billy said artfully.
Caroline liked to have him get an artistic
perspective on New York. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down
the avenue to the Caf&eacute; des Artistes and have
Eminc&eacute; Bernard, and a long wide high, tall
drink of&mdash;ginger ale,&rdquo; he finished lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to telephone Nancy,&rdquo; Caroline
hesitated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' ></a>168</span></div>
<p>Billy took her by the arm and guided her
into the interior of the drug-store to the side
aisle where the telephones were, and stepped
into the first empty booth that offered. Caroline
stopped him firmly as he was about to shut
himself inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather hear what you say,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Billy slipped his nickel in the slot and took up
the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madison Square 3403 doesn&rsquo;t answer,&rdquo; Central
informed him crisply after an interval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Nancy, dear,&rdquo; Billy replied softly into
her astonished ear. &ldquo;Caroline and I are going
off by ourselves to-night, you don&rsquo;t care, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ringing thr-r-ree-four-o-thr-r-ee, Madison
Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you,&rdquo; Billy responded heartily.
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madison Square thr-r-ree-four-o-t-h-r-r-ree
doesn&rsquo;t answer. Hang up your receiver and I&rsquo;ll
call you if I get the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. You&rsquo;re always so tactful
in the way you put things, always so generous
and kind and thoughtful. I can&rsquo;t tell you how
much I appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' ></a>169</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What did Nancy say?&rdquo; Caroline asked, as
they turned away from the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard my end of the conversation,&rdquo;
Billy said blandly. &ldquo;You can deduce hers
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something about your end of the
conversation that sounded queer to me somehow.
It was odd that Central should have returned
your nickel to you after you had talked
so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Billy asked innocently.
&ldquo;Well, I suppose mistakes will happen in the
best regulated telephone companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; Billy said contentedly, as the
lights of the avenue strung themselves out before them.
&ldquo;I like walking down this royal
thoroughfare with you. You&rsquo;re a kind of a neutral
girl, but I like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a kind of ridiculous boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me a little bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you get engaged to me for if you
only like me a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought not to be engaged to you. That&rsquo;s one
of the things I want to talk to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are engaged to me, and that&rsquo;s one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' ></a>170</span>
of the things I don&rsquo;t care to discuss&mdash;even with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Billy,&rdquo; Caroline sighed, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t we
be just good friends and see a good deal of each
other without this perpetual argument about
getting married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we can&rsquo;t, but we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Billy said firmly. &ldquo;What was the other thing
you wanted to talk to me about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s affairs. The reckless&mdash;the criminal
way she is running that restaurant, and the
unthinkable expenditure of money involved. I
can&rsquo;t sleep at night thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought this was going to be a pleasant
evening,&rdquo; Billy cried to the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d be serious about this,&rdquo; Caroline
said. &ldquo;Nancy&rsquo;s the best friend I have in
the world, and she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be quite right
in her mind, Billy. Of course, I approve of a
good part of her scheme. I believe that she
can be of incalculable value as a pioneer in an
enterprise of this sort. Her restaurant is
based on a strictly scientific theory, and every
person who patronizes it gets a balanced ration,
if he has the good sense to eat it as it&rsquo;s served.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' ></a>171</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And not leave any protein on his plate,&rdquo;
Billy murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even mind the slight extra expenditure
and the deficit that is bound to follow
her theory of stuffing all her subnormal
patrons with additional nourishment. That is
charity. I believe in devoting a certain amount
of one&rsquo;s income to charity, but what I mind
about the whole proceeding is the crazy way
that Nancy is running it. She&rsquo;s not even trying
to break even. She orders all the delicacies
of the season&mdash;no matter what they are. She&rsquo;s
paid an incredible amount for the new set of
carved chairs she has bought for up-stairs.
You&rsquo;d think she had an unlimited fortune behind
her, instead of being in a position where
the sheriff may walk in upon her any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handy men to have around the house,&mdash;sheriffs.
I knew a deputy sheriff once that
helped the lady of the house do a baby wash
while he was standing around in charge of the
place. All the servants had deserted, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pretend to be Nancy&rsquo;s friend, and
you&rsquo;re the only thing remotely approaching a
lawyer that she has, and yet you can shake with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' ></a>172</span>
joy at the thought of her going into bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m shaking with joy
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy must have spent at least twice the
amount of her original investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about,&rdquo; Billy agreed cheerfully.</p>
<p>Caroline turned large reproachful eyes on
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, how can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Caroline, honey love, it will
be all right. Nancy isn&rsquo;t so crazy as she seems.
She is running wild a little, I admit, but there&rsquo;s
no danger of the sheriff or any other disaster.
She knows what she&rsquo;s doing, and she&rsquo;s playing
safe, though I admit it&rsquo;s an extraordinary
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unhappy,&rdquo; Caroline said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
suppose she&rsquo;s going to marry Dick to get out of
the scrape, and that she&rsquo;s suffering because
she&rsquo;s had to make that compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine anything more dreadful
than to give up your career&mdash;your independence
because you were beaten before you could demonstrate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' ></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go right in here,&rdquo; Billy said, guiding
her by the arm through the door of the grill of
the Caf&eacute; des Artistes which she was ignoring
in her absorption.</p>
<p>It was early but the place was already
crowded with the assortment of upper cut Bohemians,
Frenchmen, and other discriminating
diners to whom the caf&eacute; owed its vogue. Billy
and Caroline found a snowy table by the window,
a table so small that it scarcely seemed to
separate them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Dick that Nancy&rsquo;s depending on,&rdquo;
Caroline shook out her mammoth napkin vigorously,
&ldquo;then I think the whole situation is
dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; Billy argued; &ldquo;have him to
fall back on&mdash;that&rsquo;s what men are for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion of women, Billy Boynton, just
about tallies with the most conservative estimate
of the Middle Ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charmed, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he grinned, then his
evil genius prompting, he continued. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that just about what you have me for&mdash;to fall
back on? You&rsquo;re fond of me. You know I&rsquo;ll
be there if the bottom drops out. You&rsquo;re sure
of me, and you&rsquo;re holding me in reserve against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' ></a>174</span>
the time when you feel like concentrating your
attention on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s the way it is. If I haven&rsquo;t got any
kick coming I don&rsquo;t see why you should have
any. You&rsquo;re worth it to me. That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caroline opened her lips to speak, and then
thought better of it. The dangerous glint in
her pellucid hazel eyes was lost on Billy. He
was watching the clear cool curve of her cheek,
the smooth brown hair brushed up from the
temple, and tucked away under the smart folds
of a premature velvet turban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like those mouse-colored clothes of yours,&rdquo;
he said contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the only reason a woman should
marry a man is that she&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likes him?&rdquo; Billy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that she can be of more use in the
world married than single. She can&rsquo;t be that
unless she&rsquo;s going to marry a man who is entirely
in sympathy with her point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I know to be unsound,&rdquo; Billy said.
&ldquo;Caroline, my love, this is a bat. Can&rsquo;t we let
these matters of the mind rest for a little? See,
I&rsquo;ve ordered <i>Petite Marmite</i>, and afterward an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' ></a>175</span>
artichoke, and all the nice fattening things that
Nancy won&rsquo;t let me eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me about Nancy,&rdquo; Caroline
said. &ldquo;It makes a lot of difference. You
haven&rsquo;t any idea how much difference it
makes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the nice little brown pots with the soup
in them,&rdquo; Billy implored her. &ldquo;Cheese, too, all
grated up so fine and white. Sprinkle it in like
little snow-flakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of all Billy&rsquo;s efforts the evening
went wrong after that. Caroline was wrapped
in a mantle of sorrowful meditation the opacity
of which she was not willing to let Billy penetrate
for a moment. After they had dined they
took a taxi-cab up-town and danced for an hour
on the smooth floor of one of the quieter hotels.
Billy&rsquo;s dancing being of that light, sure, rhythmic
quality that should have installed him irrevocably
in the regard of any girl who had
ever danced with a man who performed less
admirably. Caroline liked to dance and fell in
step with an unexpected docility, but even in
his arms, dipping, pivoting, swaying to the curious
syncopation of modern dance time, she
was as remote and cool as a snow maiden.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' ></a>176</span></div>
<p>At the table on the edge of the dancing platform
where they sat between dances, Billy
pledged her in nineteen-four <i>Chablis Mouton</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what you look like,&rdquo; he said, holding
up his glass to the light, &ldquo;or perhaps I ought to
say what you act like,&mdash;clear, cold stuff,&mdash;lovely,
but not very sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Dick,&rdquo;&mdash;Caroline refused to be diverted&mdash;&ldquo;Nancy
is merely taking the easiest
way out. Just getting married because she
hasn&rsquo;t the courage to go through any other
way. She and Dick have hardly a taste in common&mdash;they
don&rsquo;t even read the same books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does that make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know I can&rsquo;t tell you. When
you see somebody else in danger of following
the same course of action that you, yourself,
are pursuing,&rdquo; she added cryptically, &ldquo;it puts
a new face on your own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Billy said, signaling
for his check.</p>
<p>Caroline lived, for the summer while her
family were away, in an elaborate Madison Avenue
boarding-house. The one big room into
which the entrance gave, dim and palatial in
effect&mdash;at least in the light of the single gas-jet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' ></a>177</span>
turned economically low&mdash;seemed scarcely to
present a departure from its prototype, the
great living hall of the private residence for
which the house was originally designed. It was
only on the second floor that the character of the
establishment became unmistakable. Billy took
Caroline&rsquo;s latchkey from her,&mdash;she usually
opened the door for herself&mdash;and let her quietly
into the dim interior. Then he stepped inside
himself, and closed the door gently after him.
Being a man he entirely failed to note the drift
of psychological straws that indicated the sudden
sharp turn of the wind, and the presage
of storm in the air. He was thinking only of
the illusive, desirable, maddening quality of the
girl that walked beside him, filled with inexplicable
forebodings for a friend, whom he knew
to be invulnerable to misfortune. Certain
phrases of Dick&rsquo;s were ringing in his ears to
the exclusion of all more immediate conversational
fragments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cave-man stuff&mdash;that&rsquo;s the answer to you
and Caroline.... This watchful waiting&rsquo;s
entirely the wrong idea....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy made a great lunge toward the figure
of his fianc&eacute;e, and caught her in his arms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' ></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never really kissed you before,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;now I shan&rsquo;t let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She struggled in his arms, but he mastered
her. He covered her cool brow with kisses, her
hands, the lovely curve of her neck where the
smooth hair turned upward, and at last&mdash;her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine, my girl,&rdquo; he exulted, &ldquo;and
nothing, nothing, nothing shall ever take you
away from me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a click in the latch of the door
through which they had just entered. Another
belated boarder was making his way into the
domicile which he had chosen as a substitute
for the sacred privacy of home. Caroline tore
herself out of Billy&rsquo;s arms just in time to exchange
greetings with the incoming guest with
some pretense of composure. He was a fat man
with an umbrella which clattered against the
balusters as he ascended the carved staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught with the goods,&rdquo; Billy tried to say
through lips stiffened in an effort at control.</p>
<p>Caroline turned on him, her face blazing with
anger, the transfiguring white rage of the
woman whose spiritual fastnesses have been
invaded through the approach of the flesh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' ></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is no way of my ever forgiving you,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;No way of my ever tolerating you,
or anything you stand for again. You are utterly&mdash;utterly&mdash;utterly
detestable in my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that so?&rdquo; Billy stammered, dizzied by
the suddenness of the onslaught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got some decent hold on my pride
and self-respect&mdash;even if Nancy hasn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m
not going to be subjugated like a cave woman
by mere brute force either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Billy weakly, his mind in
a whirl still from the lightning-like overthrow
of all his theories of action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do what Nancy is going to
do, just out of sheer temperamental weakness,
and&mdash;and tendency to follow the line of least
resistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy had no idea of the significance of her
last phrase, and let it go unheeded. Caroline
turned and walked away from him, her head
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good lord, Nancy isn&rsquo;t going to do it,&rdquo;
he called after her retreating figure, but all the
answer he got was the silken swish of her petticoat
as she took the stairs.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>More Cave-Man Stuff</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>When Nancy left Collier Pratt&rsquo;s studio
on the day of her first sitting for the
portrait he was to do of her, she never expected
to enter it again. She was in a panic of hurt
pride and anger at his handling of the situation
that had developed there, and in a passion of
self-disgust that she had been responsible for it.</p>
<p>It was a simple fact of her experience that
the men she knew valued her favors, and exerted
themselves to win them. She had always
had plenty of suitors, or at least admirers who
lacked only a few smiles of encouragement to
make suitors of them, and she was accustomed
to the consideration of the desirable woman,
whose privilege it is to guide the conversation
into personal channels, or gently deflect it
therefrom. An encounter in which she could
not find her poise was as new as it was bewildering
to her.</p>
<p>From the moment that she had begun to
realize Collier Pratt&rsquo;s admiration for her she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' ></a>181</span>
had scarcely given a thought to any other man.
With the insight of the artist he had seen
straight into the heart of Nancy&rsquo;s secret&mdash;the
secret that she scarcely knew herself until he
translated it for her, the most obvious secret
that a prescient universe ever throbbed with,&mdash;that
a woman is not fulfilled until she is a mate
and a mother. The nebulous urge of her spirit
had been formulated. In Nancy&rsquo;s world there
was no abstract sentimentality&mdash;if this man indulged
himself in emotional regret for her frustrated
womanhood&mdash;she called it that to herself&mdash;it
must in some way concern him. She had
never in her life been troubled by a condition
that she was not eager to ameliorate, and she
could not conceive of an emotional interest in
an individual disassociated from a certain responsibility
for that individual&rsquo;s welfare. She
took Collier Pratt&rsquo;s growing tenderness for her
for granted, and dreamed exultant dreams of
their romantic association.</p>
<p>The scene in the studio had shocked her only
because he put his art first. He had taken a
lover&rsquo;s step toward her, and then glancing at
the crudely splotched canvas from which his
ideal of her was presently to emerge, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' ></a>182</span>
thought better of it, soothing her with caresses
as if she were a child, and like a child dismissing
her. She felt that she never wanted to see
again the man who could so confuse and humiliate
her. But this mood did not last. As
the days went on, and she feverishly recapitulated
the circumstances of the episode, she began
to feel that it was she who had failed to respond
to the beautiful opportunity of that hour.
She had inspired the soul of an artist with a
great concept of womanhood, and had, in effect,
demanded an immediate personal tribute from
him. He had been wise to deflect the emotion
that had sprung up within them both. After
the picture was done&mdash;. She became eager to
show him that she understood and wanted to
help him conserve the impression of her from
which his inspiration had come, and when he
asked her to go to the studio again the following
week she rejoiced that she had another chance
to prove to him how simply she could behave in
the matter.</p>
<p>She looked in the mirror gravely every night
after she had done her hair in the prescribed
pig-tails to try to determine whether or not the
look he had discovered in her face was still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' ></a>183</span>
there,&mdash;the look of implicit maternity that she
had been fortunate enough to reflect and symbolize
for him,&mdash;but she was unable to come to
any decision about it. Her face looked to her
much as it had always looked&mdash;except that her
brow and temples seemed to have become more
transparent and the blue veins there seemed to
be outlined with an even bluer brush than usual.</p>
<p>She was busier than she had ever been in her
life. The volume of her business was swelling.
With the return of the native to the city of his
adoption&mdash;there is no native New Yorker in the
strict sense of the word&mdash;Outside Inn was besieged
by clamorous patrons. Gaspard, with the
adaptability of his race, had evolved what was
practically a perfect system of presenting the
balanced ration to an unconscious populace, and
the populace was responding warmly to his
treatment. It had taken him a little time to
gauge the situation exactly, to adapt the supply
to the idiosyncrasies of the composite demand,
but once he had mastered his problem he dealt
with it inspiredly. His southern inheritance
made it possible for him to apprehend if he
could not actually comprehend the taste of a
people who did not want the flavor of nutmeg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' ></a>184</span>
in their cauliflower, and who preferred cocoanut
in their custard pie, and he realized that
their education required all the diplomacy and
skill at his command.</p>
<p>Nancy found him unexpectedly intelligent
about the use of her tables. He grasped the essential
fact that the values of food changed in
the process of cooking, and that it was necessary
to Nancy&rsquo;s peace of mind to calculate the
amount of water absorbed in preparing certain
vegetables, and that the amount of butter and
cream introduced in their preparation was an
important factor in her analysis. He also
nodded his head with evident appreciation when
she discoursed to him of the optimum amount
of protein as opposed to the actual requirements
in calories of the average man, but she never
quite knew whether the matter interested him,
or his native politeness constrained him to listen
to her smilingly as long as she might choose
to claim his attention. But the fact remained
that there was no such cooking in any restaurant
in New York of high or low degree, as that
which Gaspard provided, and as time went on,
and he realized that expense was not a factor
in Nancy&rsquo;s conception of a successfully conducted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' ></a>185</span>
restaurant, the reputation of Outside
Inn increased by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>To Nancy&rsquo;s friends&mdash;with the exception, of
course, of Billy, who was in her confidence&mdash;the
whole business became more and more puzzling.
Caroline, her susceptibility to vicarious distress
being augmented by the sensitiveness of her
own emotional state, yearned and prayed over
her alternately. Betty, avid of excitement,
spent her days in the pleasurable anticipation
of a dramatic bankruptcy. It was on Dick,
however, that the actual strain came. He saw
Nancy growing paler and more ethereal each
day, on her feet from morning till night manipulating
the affairs of an enterprise that seemed
to be assuming more preposterous proportions
every hour of its existence. He made surreptitious
estimates of expenditures and suffered
accordingly, approximating the economic unsoundness
of the Inn by a very close figure, and
still Nancy kept him at arm&rsquo;s length and flouted
all his suggestions for easing, what seemed to
him now, her desperate situation.</p>
<p>He managed to pick her up in his car one day
with Sheila, and persuaded her to a couple of
hours in the open. She was on her way home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' ></a>186</span>
from the Inn, and had meant to spend that time
resting and dressing before she went back to
consult with Gaspard concerning the night meal.
She had no complaint to make now of the usurpation
of her authority or the lack of actual
executive service that was required of her.
With the increase in the amount of business
that the Inn was carrying she found that every
particle of her energy was necessary to get
through the work of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about you,&rdquo; Dick said, as they
took the long ribbon of road that unfurled in
the direction of Yonkers, and Nancy removed
her hat to let the breeze cool her distracted
brow. His man Williams, was driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t tell me so,&rdquo; she answered a trifle
ungraciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dear is cross to-day,&rdquo; Sheila explained.
&ldquo;The milk did not come for Gaspard to make
the poor people&rsquo;s custard, <i>cr&ecirc;me renvers&eacute;</i>, he
makes&mdash;deliciously good, and we give it to the
clerking girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The buttermilk cultures were bad,&rdquo; Nancy
said. &ldquo;And I wasn&rsquo;t able to get any of the preparations
of it, that I can trust. There are one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' ></a>187</span>
or two people that ought to have it every day
and their complexions show it if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Dick said, with a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people who have worked in New York
all summer have run pretty close to their margin
of energy. You&rsquo;ve no idea what a difference
a few calories make to them, or how
closely I have to watch them, and when I have
to substitute an article of diet for the thing
they&rsquo;ve been used to, it&rsquo;s awfully hard to get
them to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it might be,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
true about people who have worked in New
York all summer, though. I have&mdash;and you
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Sheila said, &ldquo;and so is Monsieur
Dick, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vraiment, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Father isn&rsquo;t very right, though. Even when
Miss Dear has all the beautiful things in the
most beautiful colors in the world cooked for
him and sent to him, he won&rsquo;t eat them unless
she comes and sits beside him and begs him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very fond of <i>sauce verte</i>,&rdquo; Nancy said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' ></a>188</span>
hastily, &ldquo;and <i>apricot mousse</i> and <i>c&egrave;pes et pimentos</i>,
things that Gaspard can&rsquo;t make for the
regular menu,&mdash;bright colored things that
Sheila loves to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He likes <i>petit pois avec laitue</i> too and <i>haricot
coup&eacute;</i>, and <i>artichaut mousselaine</i>. Sometimes
when he does not want them Miss Dear
eats them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they are diverted to some good
use,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking into the living conditions
of my waitresses.&rdquo; Nancy changed the subject
hastily. &ldquo;Did you realize, Dick, that the
waitresses have about the unfairest deal of any
of the day laborers? They&rsquo;re not organized,
you know. Their hours are interminable, the
work intolerably hard, and the compensation
entirely inadequate. Moreover, they don&rsquo;t last
out for any length of time. I&rsquo;m trying out a
new scheme of very short shifts. Also, I&rsquo;m
having a certain sum of money paid over to
them every month from my bank. If they don&rsquo;t
know where it comes from it can&rsquo;t do them any
harm. That is, I am not establishing a precedent
for wages that they won&rsquo;t be able to earn
elsewhere. I consider it immoral to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' ></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are paying them an additional sum of
money out of your own pocket? You told me
you paid them the maximum wage, anyhow, and
they get lots of tips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but that&rsquo;s not nearly enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; Dick said dramatically, &ldquo;where do
you get the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;it comes
along. The restaurant makes some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make it pay any time that I wanted
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wonder if you are in full possession
of your senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline is affected that way, too. I feel
that she is likely to get an alienist in at any
time. She is so earnest in anything she undertakes.
She and Billy have had a scrap, did you
know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy wants to marry her, and he has
shocked her delicate feelings by suggesting it
to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine you have a good deal to do with
her feelings on the subject,&rdquo; Dick said gloomily.
&ldquo;I suppose at heart you don&rsquo;t believe in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' ></a>190</span>
marriage, or think you don&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;ve communicated
the poison to Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing of the kind,&rdquo; Nancy insisted
warmly. &ldquo;I do believe in marriage with
all my heart. I think the greatest service any
woman can render her kind in this mix-up
age is to marry one man and make that marriage
work by taking proper scientific care of
him and his children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is news to me,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;I thought
that <i>you</i> thought that the greatest service a
woman could do was to run Outside Inn, and
stuff all the derelicts with calories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a service, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were out beyond the stately decay of the
up-town drive, with its crumbling mansions and
the disheveled lawns surrounding them, beyond
the view of the most picturesque river in the
world, though, comparatively speaking, the
least regarded, covering the prosaic stretch of
dusty road between Van Courtland Park and
the town of Yonkers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the <i>Bois</i> better,&rdquo; Sheila said, &ldquo;but I
like Central Park better than the <i>Champs Elyse&eacute;s</i>.
In Paris the children are not so gay as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' ></a>191</span>
the grown-up people. Here it is the grown-up
people who are without smiles on the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is that, Dick?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always true of the maturer races, the
gaiety of the French is appreciative enthusiasm,&mdash;if
I may invent a phrase. The children
haven&rsquo;t developed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to have my hand held, Monsieur
Dick,&rdquo; Sheila announced. &ldquo;I always feel
homesick when I think about Paris. I was so
contente and so <i>malheureuse</i> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were you unhappy, sweetest?&rdquo; Nancy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father says I am never to speak of those
things, and so I don&rsquo;t&mdash;even to Miss Dear, my
<i>bien aim&eacute;e</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick lifted Sheila into his lap, he took the
hand that still clung to Nancy&rsquo;s in his warm
palm, and held them both there caressingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>bien aim&eacute;e</i>,&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<p>Beyond the town a more gracious and magnificent
country revealed itself; lovely homes
set high on sweeping terraces, private parks
and gardens and luxuriant estates, all in a blaze
of October radiance with the glorious pigments
of the season.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' ></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time to go back?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;I want to show you
something. There&rsquo;s an old place here I want
you to see. That colonial house set way back
in the trees there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Williams is driving in,&rdquo; Nancy said as they
approached it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to get out?&rdquo; Sheila asked.</p>
<p>Dick was already opening the door of the
tonneau and assisting Nancy out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to leave Sheila with Williams, and
take you over the house, Nancy. She&rsquo;ll be more
interested in the grounds than she would in the
interior. I want you to see the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a key out of his pocket, and unlocked
the stately door. Everything about the place
was gigantic, stately,&mdash;the huge columns that
supported the roof of the porch, the big elms
that flanked it, and the great entrance hall, as
they stepped into its majestic enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a biggish sort of place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Nancy
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s rather lovely, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
Dick asked anxiously. &ldquo;These old places are
getting increasingly hard to find,&mdash;real old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' ></a>193</span>
homes, dignified and beautiful, within a reasonable
distance from town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lovely,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;it could be made
perfectly wonderful to live in. I can see this
big hall&mdash;furnished in mahogany or even
carved oak that was old enough. Thank heaven,
we&rsquo;re no longer slaves to a <i>period</i> in our decorating;
we can use anything that&rsquo;s beautiful
and suitable and not intrinsically incongruous
with a clear conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy lingered on the landing of the fine old
staircase, white banistered with a mahogany
hand-rail, that turned only once before it led
into the region up-stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather see the kitchen,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen isn&rsquo;t the thing that I&rsquo;m proudest
of. Its plumbing is early English, or Scottish,
I&rsquo;m afraid. I think this arrangement up
here is delightful. See these front suites, one
on either side of the hall. Bedroom, dressing-room,
sitting-room. Which do you like best? I
thought perhaps I might take the one that overlooks
the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy stopped still on her way from window
to window.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' ></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Thorndyke, whose house <i>is</i> this?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours&mdash;have you bought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I put the deed in my safe deposit vault
yesterday. Come in here. Isn&rsquo;t this a cunning
little guest chamber nested in the trees? Be
becoming to Betty&rsquo;s style of beauty, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; He held the door open for her ingratiatingly,
and she passed under his arm perfunctorily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth did you buy a house like
this for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;what have I to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned the rusty key in the lock deliberately,
and put it in his pocket, thus closing
them into the little musty room which had no
other exit. A branch of flaming maple leaves
tapped lightly on the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a whole lot to do with it, Nancy,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, and I&rsquo;m yours, and I want to
know how much longer you&rsquo;re going to hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hedging,&rdquo; Nancy blazed. &ldquo;Take that
key out of your pocket. This is moving-picture
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' ></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is. I can&rsquo;t get you to talk to me
any other way, so I thought I&rsquo;d try main force
for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a change,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Shall I
begin to scream now, or do you intend to give
me some other provocation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be coarse, darling.&rdquo; There is a certain
disadvantage in having known the woman
who is the object of your tenderest emotions all
your life, and to be on terms of the most familiar
badinage with her. Dick was feeling this
disadvantage acutely at the moment. He took
a step toward her, and put a heavy hand on her
shoulder. &ldquo;Nancy, don&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nancy said deliberately, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, and
you know very well I don&rsquo;t. Unlock that door,
and let&rsquo;s be sensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, dear, or care that you&rsquo;re
hurting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;You say so, and I
hear you, but I don&rsquo;t really believe it. If I
did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d be sorrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t sorry at all, as it stands.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' ></a>196</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I find it&rsquo;s awfully hard to be sorry for you,
Dick, in any connection. There&rsquo;s really nothing
pathetic about you, no matter how tragic you
think you are being. You&rsquo;re rich and lucky and
healthy. You have everything you want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you live the way you want to, and eat
the food you want to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruling passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make the jokes you want to.&rdquo; Nancy
literally stuck up a saucy nose at him. &ldquo;There
is really nothing that I could contribute to your
happiness. I mean nothing important. You
are not a poor man whom I could help to work
his way up to the top, or a genius that needs
fostering, or a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dyspeptic that needs putting on a special
diet,&mdash;but for all that I do need a mother&rsquo;s love,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you do,&rdquo; Nancy said, a trifle
absently. &ldquo;Unlock the door, Dick. I don&rsquo;t think
Sheila put on that sweater when I told her to,
and I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll get cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you unlock the door if I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;um.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' ></a>197</span></div>
<p>Nancy put up cool fragrant lips to meet a
brother&rsquo;s kiss, and for the moment was threatened
with a second salute that was very much
less fraternal, but the danger passed. Dick unlocked
the door and let her pass him without
protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been any other girl,&rdquo; he mused,
as they went down the stairs together companionably,
&ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t have got away with
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; Nancy asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell
you. If you&rsquo;d been any other girl I should have
thrown that key out of the window when you
began to sass me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Nancy inquired politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Dick replied finally and firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any other girls?&rdquo; Nancy asked,
faintly curious, as they stood on the deep steps
of the porch waiting for Sheila and Williams
who were emerging from the middle entrance.</p>
<p>Dick met her glance a little solemnly, and
hesitated for a perceptible instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there, Dick?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; he said.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>The Happiest Day</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>It was thoroughly characteristic of Nancy to
turn her back on the most significant facts
of her experience, and occupy herself exclusively
with its by-products. She refused to
consider herself as an heiress entitled to spend
money lavishly for her own uses, but she squandered
it on her pet enterprise. She dismissed
the idea that Dick, whom she neglected to discourage
as decisively as her growing interest in
another man would seem to warrant, had
bought a country estate for the sole purpose of
ensconcing her there as mistress. She dreamed
of Collier Pratt and his ideal of her, and presented
herself punctually at his studio as a
model for that ideal, while ignoring absolutely
the fact that he was nearly a hundred dollars
in debt to her for meals served at Outside Inn.
She had sufficient logic and common sense to
apply to these matters, and sufficient imagination
to handle them sympathetically, had she
chosen to consider them at all, but she did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' ></a>199</span>
choose. She was deep in the adventure of her
existence as differentiated from its practical
working out.</p>
<p>The day Collier Pratt finished his portrait of
her she was not alone in the studio with him.
Sheila, in a fluffy white dress with a floppy
black satin hat framing her poignant little face,
was omnipresent at the interview which succeeded
the actual two hours of absorption when
he put in the last telling strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he said, as he set aside pigments
and brushes, and divested himself of his painting
apron. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look at it now. I&rsquo;ve
got it, but I can&rsquo;t stand the strain of contemplating
it till my brain cools a trifle. Let&rsquo;s go
out and celebrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; Nancy said. This was
the moment she had dreamed of for weeks, the
hour of fruition when the work was done, and
they could face each other, man and woman
again with no strip of canvas between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place I always go when I&rsquo;ve finished a
picture is a little caf&eacute; under the shadow of
<i>Notre Dame</i>, where I get cakes and beer and an
excellent perspective on all my favorite gargoyles.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' ></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And the little birds flutter in the sun, and
eat my crumbs and the great music swells out
while you ask the <i>gar&ccedil;on</i> for another <i>bock</i>. Do
you remember, father dear, the day that <i>she</i>
found us there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember only that you made yourself ill
eating <i>Madelaines</i> and had to be taken home
<i>en voiture</i>,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said quickly. &ldquo;We
will go and have some coffee at the Caf&eacute; des
Artistes, and discuss ships and shoes and sealing
wax&mdash;anything but the art of painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And cabbages and kings,&rdquo; Sheila contributed
ecstatically. &ldquo;I used to think when I was a very
little girl and couldn&rsquo;t read English very well
that it was really Heaven where Alice went,
and it made me sad to think she was dead and
I didn&rsquo;t understand it, but now Miss Dear has
explained to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dear has made a good many things
clear to us both,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said, but he
said no more that might be even remotely construed
as referring to the issue between them,
and Nancy finished out her day with dragging
limbs and an aching empty heart that a word
of tenderness would have filled to running over.</p>
<p>But after her work for the day was done, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' ></a>201</span>
she was back in her own apartment with Sheila
tucked snugly in bed, and Hitty out for the
night with a sick friend, there came the touch
on her bell that she knew was Collier Pratt&rsquo;s;
and she opened the door to find him standing
on her threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; she said, as women
always say to the man they have that hour
given up looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure I would,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said,
&ldquo;but I did, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you sure?&rdquo; She stood beside
him in her little rectangular hall while he
divested himself of his cape, and placed his hat,
stick and gloves in orderly sequence on the
oak settee beside it. She liked to watch the
precision with which he always arranged these
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be sure?&rdquo; He turned and
faced her. &ldquo;Miss Dear,&rdquo; he said to himself
softly, &ldquo;Miss Dear,&rdquo; and she saw that in his eyes
which made the moment simpler for her to
bear.</p>
<p>She led the way into her drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light the candles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this firelight
is too good to drown in a flood of electric light!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' ></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>They were standing before the fireplace; the
embers had burned to a gentle glowing radiance.
Of the four candles she had lighted, the wick
of only one had taken fire and was burning.
Nancy&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat, and she
could not steady it. Collier Pratt took a step
forward and held out his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, this is better,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there was some place in the world
where I could be&mdash;comfortable,&rdquo; Nancy said,
when she finally lifted her head from the
shoulder of the shabby, immaculate black suit,
&ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure now, you little wonder
woman?&rdquo; He held her at the length of his
arm for a moment and gazed curiously into
her face. Then he drew her slowly toward
him again. She met his kiss bravely, so bravely
that he understood the quality of her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize that this would be the first
time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t have been any other time,&rdquo;
Nancy breathed, &ldquo;you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Oh! you little American girls, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' ></a>203</span>
your strange, straight-laced little bodies and
your fearless souls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty told you something,&rdquo; Nancy cried,
scarcely hearing him, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t true.
There never has been anybody else.&rdquo; She put
her head down on his shoulder again. &ldquo;It is
comfortable here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;where I belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the sudden passion sweep through
him,&mdash;the high avid wave of tenderness and
desire,&mdash;and she exulted as all purely innocent
women exult when that madness surges first
through the veins of the man they love. He
put his hands on her shoulders and pressed her
into the armchair by the fire, and there she took
his head on her breast and understood for all
time what it means for a woman to be called
the mother of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wonder woman,&rdquo; he murmured again.</p>
<p>She brushed the dark hair back from his
forehead and kissed his eyes. &ldquo;You dear,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;you boy, you little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly through the darkness came the
sound of a shrill cry, and the thud of a fall in
some room down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sheila,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;she has those
little nightmares and falls out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' ></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know she does,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said, &ldquo;but
she picks herself up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want
to come in and help me put her back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said with unnecessary
emphasis.</p>
<p>Nancy was of two minds about picking the
child up in her little white night-gown and
bringing her out to her father, flushed and lovely
with sleep as she was. It was Collier Pratt&rsquo;s
baby she had in her arms; her charge, the child
she loved, and the child of the man she loved,
a part of the miracle that was slowly revealing
itself to her; but a sudden sharp instinct
warned her that her impulse was ill-timed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten the child was here,&rdquo; Collier
Pratt said when she returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has to be somewhere, poor
little wretch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an extraordinarily
picturesque baby, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy crept nearer to him. He stood leaning
against the mantel and frowning slightly, but
he made no move toward her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t have nightmares often now,&rdquo;
Nancy said with stiffening lips. &ldquo;She used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' ></a>205</span>
have them almost every night, but by watching
her diet carefully we have practically eliminated
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hitty person doesn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; Collier
Pratt said. &ldquo;<i>Pas du tout</i>. She treats me as if I
were a book agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loves Sheila, she&mdash;she&rsquo;d do anything for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women who do not find me attractive
are likely to find me quite conspicuously otherwise,
I am afraid.&rdquo; He had been carefully
avoiding Nancy&rsquo;s eyes, but her little cry at this
drew his gaze. She was standing before him,
slowly blanching as if he had struck her, absolutely
still except for the trembling of her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to hold out against
all the forces of the Universe? Do you love me,
Nancy, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she whispered, once more in the
shelter of the shabby shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is madness,&rdquo; he swore as he kissed her;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re both out of our senses, Nancy; don&rsquo;t you
know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The picture is done, anyhow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how I can ever bear to look it in the
face, but I shall have to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' ></a>206</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best work I&rsquo;ve ever done,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look like it now, do I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held her off to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by jove, you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s gone, now&mdash;just
that thing I painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more commonplace from the point of
view from which I painted you. Much more
beautiful though,&mdash;much more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might paint you again,&mdash;like this. No,
I swear I won&rsquo;t. I got the thing itself down on
canvas. I&rsquo;ll never try to paint you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;that flattering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supremely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When am I going to have my picture?&rdquo; she
asked after another interlude. &ldquo;Do you want
me to send for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you the picture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
intended to if I had done merely a portrait, but
I can&rsquo;t part with this. It has got to make my
fame and fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was to have it,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
then she felt she was being ungenerous,
unworthy, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t take it, of course,
it&rsquo;s too valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' ></a>207</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be wonderful, wouldn&rsquo;t it, if my
picture did make you famous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothing but a grubby little working girl,
and you&rsquo;re a great artist,&mdash;and you love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a grubby little working girl to
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a glorious creature&mdash;a
wonder woman. I ought to go down on my
knees to you for what you&rsquo;ve given me in that
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the picture?&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I love you.
I love you. That wasn&rsquo;t in the picture&mdash;I kept
it out.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t marry him until he is ready for me,&rdquo;
she said to herself at one time during the night.
She lay perfectly quiet till morning, her hands
folded upon her breast, and her little girl pig-tails
pulled down on either side of the coverlet,
wide-eyed and tranquil. She could not bear to
sleep and forget for a moment the beautiful
thing that had happened to her between dawn
and dawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of him and Sheila,
and nourish him, and help him to sell my
picture. It isn&rsquo;t every woman who would understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' ></a>208</span>
his kind of loving, but I understand
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock Hitty came in to her, and
roused her from the light drowse into which
she had fallen at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was crying in your sleep again,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;your cheeks is all wet. I heard you the
minute I put my key into the latch. You&rsquo;re as
bad as Sheila, only I expect she suffers from
something laying hard on her stummick. It&rsquo;s
always something on your mind that starts you
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing on my mind, Hitty,&rdquo; Nancy
said, sitting up in bed, &ldquo;nothing but happiness,
I mean. In some ways, Hitty dear, this is the
happiest day that I&rsquo;ve ever waked up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there&rsquo;s other ways that it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Hitty said, opening the door to stalk out
majestically.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Betty</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady waiting to see you, sir,&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s man servant informed him on
his arrival at his apartment one evening when
he had been dining at his club, and was putting
in a leisurely appearance at his own place after
his coffee and cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she has been here since nine. She
says it&rsquo;s not important, but she insisted on
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s quarters were not, strictly speaking,
of the bachelor variety. That is, he had a suite
in one of the older apartment houses in the
fifties, a building that domiciled more families
and middle-aged married couples than sprightly
young single gentlemen. Dick had fallen heir
to the establishment of an elderly uncle, who
had furnished the place some time in the nineties
and when he grew too decrepit to keep his
foothold in New York had retired to the country,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' ></a>210</span>
leaving Dick in possession. Even if Dick
had been a conspicuously rakish young gentleman,
which he was not, the traditional dignity
of his surroundings would have certainly protected
him from incongruous indiscretion in
their vicinity.</p>
<p>Betty rose composedly from the pompous
red velour couch that ran along the wall under
a portrait of a gentleman that looked like a
Philip of Spain, but was really Dick&rsquo;s maternal
great grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t
<i>convenable</i> unless you have a chaperon somewhere
concealed. We don&rsquo;t do things like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;I wanted to see you,
so I came. In these emancipated days ladies
call upon their men friends if they like. It&rsquo;s
archaic to prattle of chaperons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still we were all brought up in the fear of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine were brought up in the fear of me. I
like this place, Dicky. Why don&rsquo;t you give us
more parties in it? You haven&rsquo;t had a crowd
here for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s so busy,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' ></a>211</span>
seem to get together any more. I&rsquo;m willing to
play host any time that the rest want to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Nancy is so busy with her old
Outside Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are busy there, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so busy that I wouldn&rsquo;t come here
when I was asked, Dicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or even when you weren&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s smile
took the edge off his obviously inhospitable suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or even when I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Betty said impudently.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mr. Thorndyke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I call you a cab, Miss Pope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, be reasonable,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s after
ten o&rsquo;clock. It is not usual for me to receive
young ladies alone here, and it looks badly.
I don&rsquo;t care for myself, of course, but for you
it looks badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only for me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care how it
looks. Come and sit down beside me, and talk
to me, Dicky, and I&rsquo;ll tell you really why I
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick folded his arms and looked down at her.
Betty&rsquo;s piquant little face, olive tinted, and pure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' ></a>212</span>
oval in contour, was turned up to him confidently;
under the close seal turban the soft
brown hair framed the childish face, while the
big dark eyes danced with mischief. She patted
the couch by her side invitingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away in fifteen minutes, Dicky dear.
It certainly wouldn&rsquo;t look well if you put me out
immediately, after all your establishment knowing
that I waited here an hour for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick took out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your trouble, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a long sad story,&rdquo; she temporized.
&ldquo;Perhaps I had better not begin on it now that
our time is so short. You wouldn&rsquo;t like to hold
my hand, would you, Dicky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; she sighed.
&ldquo;Have you seen Nancy lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking better, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preston Eustace is back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I didn&rsquo;t know he was here yet.
I knew he was coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' ></a>213</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be here six months, or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Caroline told me.&rdquo; Her voice was carefully
steadied but Dick noticed for the first
time the shadows etched under the big brown
eyes, and the flush of excitement splotched
high on her cheek-bones. She had been engaged
to Preston Eustace for three months succeeding
her twentieth birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts I think I will hold your
hand, Betty,&rdquo; he said, covering that childlike
member with his own rather brawny one. &ldquo;You
are not a very big little girl, are you, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother used to tell me that I was a very
destructive child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you were that yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about me. Let&rsquo;s talk about
you, Dicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please. I think you&rsquo;re a very interesting
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having arrived at some conclusion concerning
this unprecedented attack upon his privacy,
Dick was disposed to be kind to his unexpected
visitor. The fact that Preston Eustace was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' ></a>214</span>
town and Betty had not seen him shed an entirely
new light on her recklessness. Like every
other incident in Betty&rsquo;s history her love-affair
had been very conspicuously featured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interesting things about me just at present
are&mdash;&rdquo; he was just about to say &ldquo;six shirts
of imported gingham&rdquo; but he bethought himself
that she would be certain to demand to see
them, so he finished lamely with&mdash;&ldquo;my game of
golf, and my new dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belgian police dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken them over yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that you had bought a place up in
Westchester, but I asked Nancy, and she said
she didn&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t think Nancy appreciates
you, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so often happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious matter&mdash;being appreciated.
The only person who I ever thought really
appreciated me was Billy&rsquo;s old aunt. Every
time she saw me she used to say to me, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
such a clean-looking young man I can&rsquo;t take my
eyes off you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' ></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> clean-looking, and awfully good-looking
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I smoke, Betty?&rdquo; Dick carefully
disengaged his hand from her clinging
fingers, and a look of something like intelligence
passed between them, before Betty
turned her ingenuous child&rsquo;s stare on him
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;ll give me a cigarette, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick fumbled through his pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully stupid, but I haven&rsquo;t any about
me,&rdquo; he said, fingering what he knew that she
knew to be the well filled case he always carried
in his inner pocket. He did not approve of
women smoking.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Poor Dicky!&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fifteen minutes are up, Betty,&rdquo; he said
presently, taking out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to go then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rose politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care whether I go or stay,
do you?&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have you go, Betty,&rdquo; he said
gravely.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes filled with sudden tears, that
Dick to his surprise realized were genuine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' ></a>216</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to want me to stay,&rdquo; she said
incoherently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re just a miserable little thing
that doesn&rsquo;t want to be alone,&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone bell on the table beside him
rang sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going out,&rdquo; he said to Billy, on the
wire. &ldquo;Betty is here with a fit of the blues.
I&rsquo;m going to take her home. Ride up with us,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll meet us down-stairs in ten minutes,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll order a taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see Billy,&rdquo; Betty said rebelliously.
She rose suddenly, pulling on her
gloves, and took a step forward as if about to
brush by him petulantly, but as she did so she
staggered, put her hand to her eyes, and fell
forward against his breast.</p>
<p>Dick picked up the limp little body, and made
his way to the couch where he deposited it
gently among the stiff red pillows there. Then
he began to chafe her hands, to push back the
tumbled hair from which the fur hat had been
displaced, and finally fallen off, and to call out
her name remorsefully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' ></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, dear, dearest,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know, I didn&rsquo;t dream,&mdash;I thought you were just
trying it on. I&rsquo;m so sorry, dear, I am so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moaned softly, and he bent over her again
more closely. Then he gathered her up in his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, dear, Betty,&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. Her two soft arms stole
up around his neck, and she lifted her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little devil,&rdquo; Dick cried, almost at the
same instant that he kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She deserves to be spanked,&rdquo; he told Billy
grimly at the door. &ldquo;She got in my apartment
when I was out, and insisted on staying there
till I came in, to make me a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; Betty complained,
as she cuddled confidingly in the corner of
the taxi-cab, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m serious he doesn&rsquo;t
realize or appreciate it, and he doesn&rsquo;t understand
the nature of my practical jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like&mdash;practical jokes,&rdquo; Dick said.
&ldquo;Have you seen Preston Eustace, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Caroline,&rdquo; Billy said, as if
that disposed of all the interrogatory remarks
that might be addressed to him in the present
or the future.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' ></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice-looking river,&rdquo; Betty said, looking
out at the softly gleaming surface of the
Hudson, as their cab took the drive. &ldquo;It looks
strange to-night, though, laden with all kinds
of queer little boats. I wonder how it would
feel to be drifting down it, or up it, on a barque
or a barkentine&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what a barkentine
is&mdash;all dead like Elaine or Ophelia,&mdash;with
your hands neatly folded across your breast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven sake&rsquo;s, Betty,&rdquo; Billy cried, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like your style of conversation. I&rsquo;m in a
state of gloom myself, to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was in a state of gloom,&rdquo;
Betty said. They rode the rest of the way in
silence, but when Dick got out of the cab to
open her door for her, she whispered to him,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully ashamed, Dick,&rdquo; before she fled
up-stairs through the darkened hallway of her
own home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer little thing,&mdash;Betty,&rdquo; Billy said as
Dick stepped back to the cab again, &ldquo;you never
know where you have her. Full of the deuce as
she can stick. Unscrupulous little rascal, too,
but made of good stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; Billy inquired presently
as Dick did not answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' ></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Think what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Betty&rsquo;s a queer sort of girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick took his pipe out of his pocket and began
stuffing it full of tobacco. When this was satisfactorily
accomplished, he struck a match on
his boot heel, and lit the mixture, drawing at it
critically meanwhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn&rsquo; queer,&rdquo; he admitted, between puffs.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Clouds of Glory</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nancy, trailing clouds of glory, took up the
management of her Inn with renewed
vigor. She had found her touchstone. The
flower of love, which she had scarcely understood
to be indigenous to the soil of her own
practical little garden, had suddenly lifted up
its head there in fragrant, radiant bloom. She
was so happy that she was impatient of all the
inadequate, inefficient manipulation of affairs in
the whole world. She felt strong and wise to
put everything right in a neglected universe.</p>
<p>She loved. She was satisfied to live in that
love for the present, with no imagination of the
future except as her lover should construct it
for her; and in him she had absolute faith.
The things that he had said or left unsaid had
no significance to her. Before she had dreamed
of a personal relation with him he had singled
her out as a creature made for the consummation
and fulfilment of the greatest passion
of all. The merest suspicion that there had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' ></a>221</span>
been a man in the world who could have frustrated
this beautiful potentiality in her had
moved him profoundly. There was nothing in
her experience to help her to differentiate
between the sensibility of the artistic temperament
and the manifestations of the more reliable
emotions. The presence in the human
breast of a fire that gave out light and not heat
was a condition undreamed of in her philosophy.
To doubt Collier Pratt&rsquo;s love for her in
the face of his tacit pursuit of her, and the
acceptance of the obligation she had chosen to
put him under, would have seemed to her the
rankest kind of heresy.</p>
<p>She had been brought up on terms of comradely
equality with boys and men, and she
understood the rules of all the pretty games of
fluffing and light flirtation that young men and
women play with each other, but serious love-making&mdash;that
was a thing apart. In the world
of honor and fair dealing a man took a woman&rsquo;s
kiss of surrender for one reason and one reason
only&mdash;&mdash;that she was his woman, and he so held
her in his heart.</p>
<p>Now that she was in this sort committed to
her love for Collier Pratt, her one ambition was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' ></a>222</span>
to put her life in order for him,&mdash;to pick up the
raveling threads of her achievement and prove
to him and to herself that she was the kind of
woman who accomplishes that which she
attempts. In the light of his indefatigable
patience in all matters that pertained to his
art&mdash;his clean-cut workmanship&mdash;his skill in
handling his material&mdash;she blushed for the
amateur spirit that animated all her undertakings,
and for the first time recognized it
for what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaspard,&rdquo; she said one morning soon after
her miracle had been achieved, &ldquo;where do you
think the greatest leak is? We spend a great
deal too much money in running this place.
As you know, that is not the most important
matter to me. Getting my customers properly
nourished with invitingly prepared food is the
essential thing, but if there was a way to adjust
the economical end of it, I should feel a great
deal more comfortable in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But certainly, mademoiselle, I should like
myself to try the pretty little economies. The
Frenchman he likes to spend his money when it
is there, but it hurts him in the heart to waste
this money without cause.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' ></a>223</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I wasting money without cause, Gaspard,
in your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By calculation of the tall cost of living,
and by buying what is good instead of what is
expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Gaspard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaspard contemplated her for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had this week&mdash;squab chicken,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;racks of little unseasonable lambs, sweetbreads,
guinea fowl and <i>filet du boeuf</i>. We
have with them mushrooms, fresh string bean,
cooked endive, and new, not very good peas
grown in glass. We have the salted nuts, the
radish, the olive, the celery, the <i>bon bon</i>, all
extra without pay. Then you make in addition
to this the health foods, and your bills are
sky high up. Is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is, Gaspard. I had no idea I
was as reckless as all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes, and more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do if you were running
this restaurant, Gaspard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give <i>rago&ucirc;t</i>, and rabbits&mdash;so cheap
and so good too&mdash;stewed in red wine, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' ></a>224</span>
good pot roast with vegetables all in the delicious
sauce, and carrots with parsley and the
peas out of the can, cooked with onion and lettuce,
and mac&eacute;doine of all the other things left
over. Lentils and flageolet I should buy dried
up, and soak them out.&mdash;All those things which
you have said were needless.&mdash;In my way they
would be so excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make my mouth water, Gaspard. I
don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s a Gallic eloquence, or
whether that food really would work. They
might like it for a change anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have many personal patrons now,&rdquo; Gaspard
said with some pride; &ldquo;all day they send
me messages, and very good tips. I think what
I would serve them they would eat.&mdash;But there
is one thing&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and hesitated dejectedly,
&ldquo;that, what you say, takes the heart out
of the beautiful cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing is that, Gaspard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those calories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gaspard, surely you&rsquo;re used to working
with tables now. It must be almost second
nature to you. My whole end and aim has been
to serve a balanced ration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but the ration when he is right,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' ></a>225</span>
he balances himself. These tables they are like
the steps in dancing&mdash;to learn and to forget.
I figure all day all night to get those calories,
and then I find I have eight&mdash;and eight are so
little&mdash;lesser than I would have had without the
figuring, and if our customer he has taken himself
one piece of sweetmeat outside, he has
more than made it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always have worried about what they eat
between meals,&rdquo; Nancy said,&mdash;&ldquo;but that, of
course, we can&rsquo;t regulate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I perhaps go to it, as you say, and
cook like the <i>bourgeoisie</i> for a week or two of
trials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you could, Gaspard,&rdquo; Nancy
said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Go to it, as we say, and I
won&rsquo;t interfere in any way. Maybe they&rsquo;d
like it. Perhaps our food is getting to be too
much like hotel food, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew in her heart that the gradually
increasing scale of luxury on which she had
been running her cuisine had been largely due
to her desire to provide Collier Pratt with all
the delicacies he loved, without making the
fact too conspicuous. The specially prepared
dishes sent out to his table had become a matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' ></a>226</span>
of so much comment among the members of the
staff, and the target of so much piquant satire
from Betty that she had become sensitive on the
subject, especially since Betty had access to the
books, and knew in actual dollars and cents
how much this favoritism was costing her.
Now that matters had been settled between
herself and her lover, she felt vaguely ashamed
of this elaboration of method. It was so simple
a thing to love a man and give him all you had,
with the eyes of the world upon you, if necessary.
She felt that she handled the matter
rather unworthily.</p>
<p>She had also a consultation with Molly and
Dolly about the economic problem, and discovered
that they agreed with Gaspard about the
unnecessary extravagance of her management.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them health foods,&rdquo; Dolly said,&mdash;she was
not the more grammatical of the twins, &ldquo;the
ones that gets them regular gets so tired of
them, or else they gets where they don&rsquo;t need
them any more. There&rsquo;s one girl that crumbs
up her health muffins and puts them on the
window-sill every day when I ain&rsquo;t looking, so&rsquo;s
not to hurt my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' ></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That accounts for all those chittering sparrows,&rdquo;
Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some of those buttermilk men threatens
not to come any more if I don&rsquo;t stop serving
it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to them, Dolly, when they
object to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sometimes I say one thing, and sometimes
another. Sometimes I say it&rsquo;s orders to
serve it; and sometimes I say will they please
to let it stand by their plate not to get me in
trouble with the management; and sometimes
I coax them to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an appeal to their better nature,&rdquo; Nancy
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Dick can&rsquo;t hear all this,&mdash;he&rsquo;d
think it was funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have so much trouble with the
broths,&rdquo; Molly said, &ldquo;but so many people would
rather have the cream soups Gaspard makes,
that we waste a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sours on us,&rdquo; Dolly elucidated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think would be the best way
out of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think to charge for the invalid things,&rdquo;
Dolly said; &ldquo;people would think more of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' ></a>228</span>
if they was specials, and had to be paid good
money for. Health bread, if you didn&rsquo;t call
it that, would go good, if it cost five cents
extra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you call it?&rdquo; Nancy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;California fruit nut bread, or something
like that, and call the custards cr&ecirc;me renvers&eacute;,
and the ice-cream, French ice-cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t the way
I want to do things at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can slip the ones that needs them a few
things from time to time, can&rsquo;t we, Molly?&rdquo;
Dolly said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I hate the way
that the most uninspired ways of doing things
turn out to be the best policy after all. I don&rsquo;t
believe in stereotyped philanthropy, but I did
think I had found a way around this problem of
feeding up people who needed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get fed up pretty good if they do pay
a regular price for it,&rdquo; Dolly said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
get something for nothing in this world, and
most everybody knows it by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m managing my restaurant a little differently,&rdquo;
she told Collier Pratt a few days later,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' ></a>229</span>
as she took her place at the little table beside
him, where she habitually ate her dinner. &ldquo;If
you don&rsquo;t like it you are to tell me, and I&rsquo;ll see
that you have things you will like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dinner is good,&rdquo; he said reflectively,
&ldquo;like French home cooking. I haven&rsquo;t had a
real <i>rago&ucirc;t</i> of lamb since I left the pension of
Madame Pellissier. Has your mysterious
patroness got tired of furnishing <i>diners de
luxe</i> to the populace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but she&mdash;she
wants me to try out another way of doing
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would come. That&rsquo;s the
trouble with patronage of any kind. It is so
uncertain. There is no immediate danger of
your being ousted, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;there&mdash;there is no danger
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that cutting you down,&rdquo; he said,
frowning. &ldquo;It would be rather a bad outlook
for us all if she threw you over, now wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;she won&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry
about, really.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' ></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be like my luck to have the only
caf&eacute; in America turn me out-of-doors.&mdash;I should
never eat again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have trusted any woman&mdash;but you,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust me,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;The truth
is, she couldn&rsquo;t put me out even if she wanted
to. I&mdash;she is under a kind of obligation to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that. I only hope you are
in a position to threaten her with blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could if anybody could,&rdquo; Nancy said. She
put out of her mind as disloyal, the faintly
unpleasant suggestion of his words. He owed
her mythical patron a substantial sum of money
by this time. He was not even able to pay
Michael the cash for the nightly teapot full of
Chianti that Nancy herself now sent out for
him regularly. For the first time since her
association with him she was tempted to compare
him to Dick, and that not very favorably;
but at the next instant she was reproaching
herself with her littleness of vision. He was
too great a man to gauge by the ordinary standards
of life. Money meant nothing to him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' ></a>231</span>
except that it was the insignificant means to the
end of that Art, which was to him consecrated.</p>
<p>They were placed a little to the left of the
glowing fire&mdash;Nancy had restored the fireplace
in the big central dining-room&mdash;and the light
took the brass of the andirons, and all the
polished surface of copper and pewter and silver
candelabra that gave the room its quality
of picturesqueness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of those branching candlesticks are
very beautiful,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the impression here
is a little like that of a Catholic altar just before
the mass. I&rsquo;ve always thought I&rsquo;d like to have
my meals served in church, <i>Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s</i>
for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather dim religious light.&rdquo; Nancy had
no wish to utter this banality, but it was forced
from her by her desire to seem sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go to your place for a little while
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the words she had spent her days
and nights hungering for; yet now she hesitated
for a perceptible instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can, of course. There is a friend
of mine&mdash;Billy Boynton, up there this evening.
He is not feeling very fit, and phoned to ask
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' ></a>232</span>
if he could go up and sprawl before my fire, so,
of course, I said he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, Sheila&rsquo;s friend. Can&rsquo;t he be disposed
of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. We could try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at Nancy&rsquo;s apartment they found not
only Billy, but Caroline, and the atmosphere
was like that of the glacial regions, both literally
and figuratively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitty had the windows open, and the fire
went out, and I forgot to turn on the heat,&rdquo;
Billy explained from his position on the hearth
where he was trying to build an unscientific
fire with the morning paper, and the remains of
a soap box. There was a long smudge across
his forehead.</p>
<p>Caroline drew Nancy into the seclusion of her
bedroom and clutched her violently by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand the strain any longer,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to tell me. Are you or are
you not going to marry Dick Thorndyke for his
money, and is Billy Boynton putting you up to
it&mdash;out of cowardice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not and he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you and Billy anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' ></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for weeks before. I just
happened to be in this neighborhood to-night,
and ran in here, and there he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take him home with you?&rdquo;
Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to go home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. That isn&rsquo;t the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the point,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t
any other point to the whole of existence.
There&rsquo;s nothing else in the world, but love, the
great, big, beautiful, all-giving-up kind of love,
and bearing children for the man you love; and
if you don&rsquo;t know that yet, Caroline, go down
on your bended knees and pray to your God
that He will teach it to you before it is too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know you felt like that,&rdquo; Caroline
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;and I think that
any woman who doesn&rsquo;t is just confusing issues,
and taking refuge in sophistry. I wouldn&rsquo;t give
<i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she snapped an energetic forefinger,
&ldquo;for all your silly, smug little ideas of economic
independence and service to the race, and
all that tommy-rot. There is only one service
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' ></a>234</span>
a woman can do to her race, and that is to
take hold of the problems of love and marriage,&mdash;and
the problems of life, birth and death that
are involved in them&mdash;and work them out to
the best of her ability. They <i>will</i> work out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re a sort of a pragmatist, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Caroline gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy loves you, and you love Billy. Billy
needs you. He is the most miserable object
lately, that ever walked the face of the earth.
I&rsquo;m going to call a taxi-cab, and send you both
home in it, and when you get inside of it I want
you to put you arms around Billy&rsquo;s neck, and
make up your quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Caroline, &ldquo;but&mdash;but
somehow or other you&rsquo;ve cleared up something
for me. Something that was worrying me a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I call the taxi?&rdquo; Nancy said inexorably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;if&mdash;if you want to,&rdquo; Caroline
said.</p>
<p>The fire was crackling merrily in the drawing-room
when she stepped into it again after
speeding her departing guests. Collier Pratt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' ></a>235</span>
was walking up and down impatiently with his
hands clasped behind his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got rid of them at last,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
was afraid they would decide to remain with
us indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have as much trouble as I anticipated,&rdquo;
admitted Nancy cryptically.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt made a round of the rose-shaded
lamps in the room&mdash;there were three including
a Japanese candle lamp,&mdash;and turned them all
deliberately low. Then he held out his arms
to Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll snatch at the few moments of joy the
gods will vouchsafe us,&rdquo; he said.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XVI_CHRISTMAS_SHOPPING'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Christmas Shopping</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Sheila and Nancy were doing their Christmas
shopping. The weather, which had
been like mid-May&mdash;even to betraying a bewildered
Jersey apple tree into unseasonable bloom
that gave it considerable newspaper notoriety,&mdash;had
suddenly turned sharp and frosty.
Sheila, all in gray fur to the beginning of her
gray gaiters, and Nancy in blue, a smart blue
tailor suit with black furs and a big black
satin hat&mdash;she was dressing better than she had
ever dressed in her life&mdash;were in that state of
physical exhilaration that follows the spur of
the frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t dance down the avenue, Sheila,&rdquo;
Nancy said, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t done, in the circles in
which we move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who are almost very nearly dancing,
Miss Dear,&rdquo; Sheila said, &ldquo;I was only walking
on my toetips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you feel good, Sheila?&rdquo; Nancy
cried.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' ></a>237</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, Miss Dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel almost too good,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;as if
in another minute the top of the world might
come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The top of the world is screwed on very
tight, I think,&rdquo; said Sheila. &ldquo;I used to think
when I was a little girl that it was made out of
blue plush, but now I know better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; Nancy argued, &ldquo;blue plush
and bridal veils. There&rsquo;s a great deal of filmy
white about it, to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way off from Fifth Avenue,&rdquo;
Sheila sighed, &ldquo;too far. I am not going to
think about it any more. I am going to think
hard about what to give my father. Michael
said to get a smoking set, but I don&rsquo;t know
what a smoking set is. Hitty said some hand
knit woolen stockings, but I am afraid he would
be scratched by them. Gaspard said a big bottle
of <i>Cointreau</i>, but I do not know what that is
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we give him a beautiful brocaded
dressing-gown and a Swiss watch, thin as a
wafer, and some handkerchiefs cobwebby fine,
and a dozen bottles of <i>Cointreau</i>, and&mdash;then get
the other things as we think of them?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' ></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are we rich enough to do <i>that</i>?&rdquo; Sheila
asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich enough to buy anything we want,
Sheila,&rdquo; Nancy cried. &ldquo;I had no idea it was going
to be such a heavenly feeling. When you
say your prayers to-night, Sheila, I hope you
will ask God to bless somebody you&rsquo;ve never
heard of before. <i>Elijah Peebles Martin</i>, do you
think you could remember that long name,
Sheila?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Dear,&mdash;do you remember him in
your prayers every night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but I intend
to from now on. Do you think Collier&mdash;father&mdash;would
like to have a new pipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Shelia said; &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t Uncle
Dick like to have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether Uncle Dick is going to
want a Christmas present from me or not,
Sheila.&rdquo; Nancy answered seriously. &ldquo;There
may be&mdash;reasons why he won&rsquo;t come to see us
for a while when he knows them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Sheila said, &ldquo;but I can buy him a
Christmas present myself, can&rsquo;t I? I don&rsquo;t
want it to be Christmas if I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' ></a>239</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, dear. What shall we buy Aunt
Caroline and Uncle Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some pink and blue housekeeping dishes, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have trouble buying Caroline
<i>anything</i>,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so sure I can&rsquo;t
afford it. If I give a silver chest I&rsquo;ll have to
make Billy say it came from his maiden aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we give Aunt Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly why,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but
someway I feel more like giving her a good
shaking than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a little surprise,&rdquo; Sheila said presently,
&ldquo;do you think we could go down to see my father
in his studio, after we have shopped? I
feel like seeing my father to-day. Sometimes I
wake up in the morning and I think of Hitty
and my breakfast, and the canary bird, and of
you, Miss Dear, fast asleep where I can hear
you breathing in your room&mdash;if I listen to it&mdash;and
then other mornings I wake up thinking
only of my father, and how he looks in his
shirt-sleeves and necktie. I was thinking of
him this morning like that. So now I should
like to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' ></a>240</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall, dear. I want him to see you in
your new clothes. He&rsquo;ll think you look like a
little gray bird with a scarlet breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must open the front of my coat when
I go in so he shall see my vest at once, mustn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much I love you, Sheila?&rdquo;
Nancy cried suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a great deal, Miss Dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;ve ever loved anybody in
this world but one person, and if I should ever
be separated from you I think it would break
my heart&mdash;so that you could hear it crack with
a loud report, Sheila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl slipped her gray gloved hand
into Nancy&rsquo;s and held it there silently for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t ever be separated, Miss
Dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The shops were crowded with the usual conglomerate
Christmas throng, and their progress
was somewhat retarded by Sheila&rsquo;s desire to
make the acquaintance of every department-store
and Salvation Army Santa Claus that
they met in their peregrinations. In the toy
department of one of the Thirty-fourth Street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' ></a>241</span>
shops there was a live Kris Kringle with animated
reindeers on rollers, who made a short
trip across an open space in one end of the department
for a consideration, and presented
each child who rode with him a lovely present,
tied up in tissue and marked &ldquo;Not to be opened
until Christmas.&rdquo; Sheila refused a second trip
with him on the ground that it would not be
polite to take more than one turn.</p>
<p>Nancy was able to discover the little girl&rsquo;s
preferences by a tactful question here and there
when they were making the rounds of the different
counters. She wanted, it developed, a
golden-haired doll with a white fur coat, a pair
of roller skates, an Indian costume, a beaded
pocketbook, with a blue cat embroidered on it, a
parchesi board to play parchesi with her Uncle
Dick, some doll&rsquo;s dinner dishes, a boy&rsquo;s bicycle,
some parlor golf sticks, a red leather writing
set, a doll&rsquo;s manicure set, a sailor-boy paper
doll, a dozen small suede animals in a box, a
drawing book and crayon pencils and several
other trifles of a like nature. The things she
did not want she rejected unerringly. It
pleased Nancy to realize that she knew exactly
what she did want, even though her range of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' ></a>242</span>
taste was so extensive. Nancy had a sheaf of
her own cards with her address on them in her
pocketbook, and each time Sheila saw the thing
her heart coveted Nancy nodded to the saleswoman
and whispered to her to send it to the
address given and charge to her account.</p>
<p>They took their lunch in a famous confectionary
shop, full of candy animals and alluring
striped candy sticks and baskets. Here
Sheila&rsquo;s eye was taken by a basket of spun
sugar flowers, which she insisted on buying for
Gaspard. By the time they were ready to resume
their shopping tour, Sheila began to show
signs of fag, so they bought only brooches for
the waitresses, and the watch as thin and exquisite
of workmanship as a man&rsquo;s pocket watch
could be, for Collier Pratt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better give it to him now,
Miss Dear,&rdquo; Sheila decided. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
he can wait till Christmas for it&mdash;it is so beautiful.
He has not had a gold watch since that
time in Paris when we had all that trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trouble, Sheila dear?&rdquo; Nancy said.
She had tucked the child in a hansom, and they
were driving slowly through the lower end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' ></a>243</span>
Central Park to restore Sheila&rsquo;s roses before
she was exhibited to her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we lost all our money, and my father
and some one I must not speak of, had those
dreadful quarrelings, and we ran away. I do
not like to think of it. My father does not like
to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you mustn&rsquo;t, dear,&rdquo; Nancy said,
&ldquo;but just be glad it is all over now. I don&rsquo;t
like to realize that so many hard things happened
to you and him before I knew you, but
I do like to think that I can perhaps prevent
them ever happening to you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed resolutely that department of her
mind that had begun to occupy itself with conjectures
concerning the past of the man to
whom she had given her heart. The child&rsquo;s
words conjured up nightmare scenes of unknown
panic and dread. It was terrible to her
to know that Collier Pratt had the memory of
so much bitterness and distress of mind and
body locked away in the secret chambers of his
soul. &ldquo;Some one of whom I must not speak,&rdquo;
Sheila had said, &ldquo;and some one of whom I must
not think,&rdquo; Nancy added to herself. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' ></a>244</span>
probably some one with whom he had quarreled
and struggled passionately maybe, with disastrous
results. He could not have injured or
killed anybody, else how could he be free and
honorably considered in a free and honorable
country? She laughed at her own melodramatic
misgivings. It was only, she realized, that
she so detested the connotation of the words
&ldquo;ran away.&rdquo; Nancy had never run away from
anything or anybody in her life, and she could
not understand that any one who was close to
her should ever have the instinct of flight.</p>
<p>The most conscientious objector to New
York&rsquo;s traffic regulations can not claim that
they fail to regulate. The progress of their
cab down the avenue was so scrupulously regulated
by the benignant guardians of the semaphores
that twilight was deepening into early
December evening before they reached their
objective point,&mdash;the ramshackle studio building
on the south side of Washington Square
where the man she loved lived, moved and had
his being, with the gallant ease and grace which
made him so romantic a figure to Nancy&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>She had never been to his studio before without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' ></a>245</span>
an appointment, and her heart beat a little
harder as, Sheila&rsquo;s hand in hers, they tiptoed
up the worn and creaking stairs, through the
ill-kept, airless corridors of the dingy structure,
till they reached the top, and stood breathless
from their impetuous ascent, within a few
feet of Collier Pratt&rsquo;s battered door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel a little scared, Miss Dear,&rdquo; Sheila
whispered. &ldquo;I thought it was going to be so
much fun and now I don&rsquo;t think so at all. Do
you think he will be very angry at my coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will be angry at all,&rdquo; Nancy
said. &ldquo;I think he will be very much surprised
and pleased to see both of us. Turn around,
dear, and let me be sure that you&rsquo;re neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheila turned obediently. Nancy fumbled
with her pocket mirror, and then thought better
of it, but passed a precautionary hand over the
back of her hair to reassure herself as to its
arrangement, and straightened her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But Sheila put out her hand, and clutched at
Nancy&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one in there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;somebody
crying. Oh! don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go in, Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From behind the closed door there issued suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' ></a>246</span>
the confused murmur of voices, one&mdash;a
woman&rsquo;s&mdash;rising and falling in the cadence of
distress, the other low pitched in exasperated
expostulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Collier,&rdquo; Nancy said mechanically, &ldquo;and
some woman with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheila shrank closer into the protecting shelter
of her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go in, Miss Dear,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be just some model,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait a minute here and see if she doesn&rsquo;t
come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to see who comes out,&rdquo; the
child said, her face suddenly distorted.</p>
<p>There was a sharp sound of something falling
within, then Collier Pratt&rsquo;s voice raised
loud in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before you
do any more damage. I don&rsquo;t want you here.
Once and for all I tell you that there is no place
for you in my life. Weeping and wailing won&rsquo;t
do you any good. The only thing for you to do
is to get out and stay out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was answered by an indistinguishable
outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you where the child is,&rdquo; Collier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' ></a>247</span>
Pratt said steadily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s well taken care of.
God knows you never took care of her. There&rsquo;s
nothing you can do, you know. You might sue
for a restitution of conjugal rights, I suppose,
but if you drag this thing into the courts I&rsquo;ll
fight it out to the end. I swear I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brute,&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first clear sound of the woman&rsquo;s voice
the child at Nancy&rsquo;s side broke into sobs of
convulsive terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me away, Miss Dear. Oh! take me
away from here, quickly, quickly, I&rsquo;m so frightened.
I&rsquo;m so afraid she&rsquo;ll come out and get me.
It&rsquo;s my <i>mother</i>,&rdquo; she moaned.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Good-By</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nancy had no memory of her actions during
the time that elapsed between leaving
the studio building and her arrival at her own
apartment. She knew that she must have
guided Sheila to the beginning of the bus route
at the lower end of the square, and as perfunctorily
signaled the conductor to let her off at
the corner of Fifth Avenue and her own street,
but she could never remember having done so.
Her first conscious recollection was of the few
minutes in Sheila&rsquo;s room, while she was slipping
off the child&rsquo;s gaiters, in the interval before
she gave her over to Hitty for the night.
The little girl was still sobbing beneath her
breath, though her emotion was by this time
purely reflexive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand that your mother was
living, Sheila,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t very nice,&rdquo; the little girl said miserably.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t tell any one. She always
cries and screams and makes us trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' ></a>249</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Did she live with you in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she do&mdash;something that she should not
do, Sheila?&rdquo; Nancy asked, with her mind on inebriety,
or drug addiction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just isn&rsquo;t very nice,&rdquo; Sheila repeated.
&ldquo;She is <i>hist&eacute;rique</i>; she pounded me with her
hands, and hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy telephoned to the Inn that she had a
headache, and shut herself into her room, without
food, to gather her scattered forces. She
lay wide-awake all the night through, her mind
trying to work its way through the lethargy of
shock it had received. She remembered falling
down the cellar stairs, when she was a little
girl, and lying for hours on the hard stone floor,
perfectly serene and calm, without pain, until
she tried to do so much as move a little finger
or lift an eyelid, when the intolerable nausea
would begin. She was calm now, until she
made the attempt to think what it was that had
so prostrated her, and then the anguish spread
through her being and convulsed her with unimaginable
distress of mind and body.</p>
<p>By morning she had herself in hand again,&mdash;at
least to the extent of dealing with the unthinkable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' ></a>250</span>
fact that Collier Pratt, her lover, the
man to whom she had given the lover&rsquo;s right to
hold her in his arms and cover her upturned
face with kisses, had a living wife, and that he
was not free to make honorable love to any
woman.</p>
<p>Her life had been too sound, too sweet, to
give her any perspective on a situation of the
kind. It was inconceivable to her that a married
man should make advances to an unmarried
woman,&mdash;but gradually she began to make
excuses for this one man whose circumstances
had been so exceptional. Tied to an insane
creature, who beat his child, who made him
strange hectic scenes, and followed him all over
the world to threaten his security, and menace
that beautiful and inexplicable creative instinct
that animated him like a holy fire, and set him
apart from his kind; she began to see how it
might be with him. She was still the woman he
loved,&mdash;she believed that; he was weaker than
she had thought,&mdash;that was all, weaker and not
so wise. This being true, she must put aside
her own pain and bewilderment, her own devastating
disillusionment, and comfort him, and
help him. She rose from her bed that morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' ></a>251</span>
firmly resolved to see him before the day was
through.</p>
<p>She breakfasted with Sheila, and made a
brave attempt to get through the morning on
her usual schedule, but once at the Inn she collapsed,
and Michael and Betty had to put her
in a cab and send her home again, where Hitty
ministered to her grimly,&mdash;and she slept the
sleep of exhaustion until well on into the evening,
and into the night again.</p>
<p>On the day following she was quite herself;
but she still hesitated to bring about the momentous
interview that she so dreaded, and yet
longed for. She intended to take her place at
the table beside Collier Pratt when he came for
his dinner that night, but when the time came
she could not bring herself to do it, and fled
incontinently. Later in the evening he telephoned
that he wanted to see her, and she told
him that he might come.</p>
<p>She faced him with the facts, breathlessly,
and in spite of herself accusingly,&mdash;and then
waited for the explanation that would extenuate
the apparent ugliness of his attitude toward
her, and set all the world right for her again.
As she looked into his face she felt that it must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' ></a>252</span>
come. She noted compassionately how the
shadows under the dark eyes had deepened;
how weary the pose of the fine head; and for the
moment she longed only to rest it on her breast
again. Even as she spoke of the thing that had
so tortured her it seemed insignificant in
light of the fact that he was there beside her,
within reach of her arms whenever she chose
to hold them out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that the revelation of my private
embarrassments should have been thrust upon
you so suddenly,&rdquo; he said, when she had poured
out the story to him. &ldquo;My marriage has proved
the most uncomfortable indiscretion that I ever
committed; and unfortunately my indiscretions
have been numberless as the well-known leaves
of Vallombrosa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always said that Sheila was motherless,&rdquo;
Nancy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simpler than stating that she is worse
than motherless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collier Pratt smiled at her&mdash;kindly it seemed
to Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hadn&rsquo;t anything to do with <i>us</i>,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I should never want to marry again&mdash;even if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' ></a>253</span>
I were free. The thought is horrible to me.
You mean a great deal to me. <i>Think</i>, if you
doubt that and think again. I have had in this
little front room of yours the only real moments
of peace and happiness that I have had
for years. I value them&mdash;you can not dream or
imagine how much&mdash;but surely it is understood
between us that our relation can not be anything
but transitory. I am an artist with a way
to make for my art: you are a working woman
with a career, odd as it is,&rdquo; he smiled whimsically,
&ldquo;that you have chosen, and that you will
pursue faithfully until some stalwart young
man dissuades you from it, when you will take
your place in your niche as wife and mother,
and leave me one more beautiful memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;you know it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it like then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy felt every sane premise, every eager
hope and delicate ideal slipping beyond her
reach as she faced his mocking, tender eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that you believe you have been&mdash;fair
with me,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have been unfair,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I have made no protestations, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' ></a>254</span></div>
<p>Nancy shut her eyes. Curious scraps of her
early religious education came back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have partaken of my bread and wine,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly consecrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Oh!
don&rsquo;t you understand that that isn&rsquo;t a way for
a man to think or to feel about a woman like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little American girl,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said,
&ldquo;little American girl, don&rsquo;t you understand that
there is only one way for a woman to think or
feel about a <i>man</i> like <i>me</i>? I have had my life,
and I haven&rsquo;t liked it much. I&rsquo;m to be loved
warmly and lightly till the flesh and blood
prince comes along, but I&rsquo;m never to be mistaken
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re sincere,&rdquo; Nancy cried;
&ldquo;women must have loved you deeply, tragically,
and have suffered all the torture there is, at
losing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be. Sincerity is a matter of so
many connotations. You haven&rsquo;t known many
artists, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;No, but I thought they
were the same as other men, only worthier.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' ></a>255</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How should they be? He who perceives a
merit is not necessarily he who achieves it.
Else the world would be a little more one-sided
than it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe those things,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;I want to believe in you. You <i>must</i> care for
me, and what becomes of me. You have known
so long what I was like, and what I was made
for. All this seems like a terrible nightmare.
I want you to tell me what it is you want of me,
and let me give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proving some faint shadow of worthiness
at least, when I say to you that I want
absolutely nothing of you. I love, but I
refrain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love,&rdquo; Nancy cried, &ldquo;you <i>love</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as you understand loving, I am afraid.
In my own way I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your way, then,&rdquo; Nancy said
wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both so poor, little girl,&mdash;that&rsquo;s one
thing. If I were free and could overcome my
prejudice against matrimony, and could be a
little surer of my own heart and its constancy,&mdash;even
then, don&rsquo;t you see, practical considerations
would and ought to stand in our way. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' ></a>256</span>
couldn&rsquo;t support you, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly support
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;Would you marry me
If I were rich?&rdquo; she said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already have one wife,&rdquo; Collier Pratt
smiled. Nancy remembered afterward that he
smiled oftener during this interview than at
any other. &ldquo;But if somebody died, and left you
a million, she might possibly be disposed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one moment, perhaps, his fate hung in
the balance. Then he took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me good night, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and let
us end this bitter and fruitless discussion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss you good night,&rdquo; Nancy cried. &ldquo;Kiss
you good night. Oh! how dare you!&mdash;How dare
you?&rdquo; And she struck him twice across his
mouth. &ldquo;I wish I could kill you,&rdquo; she blazed.
&ldquo;Oh! how dare you,&mdash;how dare you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; said Collier Pratt calmly,
wiping his mouth with his handkerchief. &ldquo;If
that&rsquo;s the way you feel&mdash;then our pleasant little
acquaintanceship is ended. I&rsquo;ll take my hat and
stick and my child&mdash;and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your child?&rdquo; Nancy cried aghast. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t take Sheila away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel exactly tempted to leave her with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' ></a>257</span>
you,&rdquo; he said deliberately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind a
woman striking me&mdash;I&rsquo;m used to that; it is one
of my charming wife&rsquo;s ways of expressing herself
in moments of stress&mdash;but I do object to
any but the most purely formal relations with
her afterward. There is a certain degree of intimacy
involved in your having charge of my
child. I think I will take the little girl away
with me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, please, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;I love her. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it now. You can&rsquo;t
be so cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get it over,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said. &ldquo;Will
you call Hitty, or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheila is in bed,&rdquo; Nancy cried. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t take her out of her warm bed to-night.
I&rsquo;ll send her to you to-morrow at whatever hour
you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask for her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no fight left in Nancy. She called
Hitty and superintended the dressing of the little
girl to its last detail. She could not touch
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me good night, Miss Dear?&rdquo;
Sheila said, drowsily, as she took her father&rsquo;s
hand at the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' ></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; Nancy said hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
a bad throat, dear, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to
catch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; the little
girl said, &ldquo;but I suppose my father knows. I&rsquo;ll
come back as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collier Pratt turned at the door and made an
exaggerated gesture of farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We part more in anger than in sorrow,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Go,&rdquo; Nancy cried.</p>
<p>As the door closed upon the two Nancy sank
to her knees, and thence to a crumpled heap on
the floor, but remembering that Hitty would
find her there shortly, and being entirely unable
to regain her feet unaided, she started to
crawl in the direction of her own room, and
presently arrived there, and pushed the door to
behind her with her heel.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Tame Skeletons</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>It was Sunday night, and New Year&rsquo;s Eve.
Gaspard was preparing, and Molly and Dolly
were serving a special dinner for Preston Eustace,
planned weeks before on his first arrival
in New York.</p>
<p>Before the great logs&mdash;imported by Michael
for the occasion&mdash;that blazed in the fireplace, a
round table was set, decorously draped in the
most immaculate of fine linen, and crowned
with a wreath of holly and mistletoe, from
which extended red satin trailers with a present
from Nancy for each guest, on the end of each.
All the impedimenta of the restaurant was
cleared away, and a couch and several easy
chairs that Nancy kept in reserve for such occasions
were placed comfortably about the
room. Only the innumerable starry candles
and branching candelabra were reminiscent of
the room&rsquo;s more professional aspect.</p>
<p>Billy and Caroline were the first to arrive,&mdash;Caroline
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' ></a>260</span>
in pale floating green tulle, which accentuated
the pure olive of her coloring, and
transported Billy from his chronic state of
adoration to that of an almost agonizing worship.
Dick and Betty were next. He had realized
the possible awkwardness of the situation
for her, and had been thoughtful enough to offer
to call for her. She was in defiant scarlet
from top to toe, and had never looked more
entrancing. Preston Eustace was to come in
from Long Island where he was spending the
holidays with a married sister. Michael received
the guests and did the honors beamingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nancy?&rdquo; Dick asked, as, divested
of his outer garments, he appeared without
warning in the presence of the lovers. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother to drop her hand, Billy. I don&rsquo;t see how
you have the heart to, she&rsquo;s so lovely to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where Nancy is,&rdquo; Caroline
answered for him. &ldquo;It seems to be all right,
though. She&rsquo;s expected, Michael says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nancy?&rdquo; Betty asked, in her turn,
appearing on the threshold with every hair most
amazingly in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; Dick reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anybody heard from her?&rdquo; Betty asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' ></a>261</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Michael has, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t worried about her, are you?&rdquo;
Caroline asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Betty said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you and Nancy were rather on the
outs,&rdquo; Caroline suggested. &ldquo;It seems odd to
have you worrying about her like her maiden
aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait till you see her, you&rsquo;ll be worried
about her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dick asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lost Sheila for one thing. That unspeakable
Collier Pratt&mdash;I hope he chokes on
his dinner to-night, and I hope it&rsquo;s a rotten dinner&mdash;has
taken the child away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a step on the rickety stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! There she is now,&rdquo; Caroline cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Betty said quietly, listening. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not Nancy. That&rsquo;s your brother, Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard his step for such a long time
I&rsquo;ve forgotten it,&rdquo; Billy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard it for a long time either,&rdquo;
Betty said, her face draining of its last bit of
color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promises to be one of those merry little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' ></a>262</span>
meals when everybody present is attended by a
tame skeleton,&rdquo; Billy whispered, &ldquo;except us,
Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that we have any right to be so
happy with the whole continent of Europe in
the state it&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; Caroline whispered in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel better about the continent of Europe
than I did a while back,&rdquo; Billy said, contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, everybody,&rdquo; Preston Eustace said as
Michael held the door for him. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s everything,
Caroline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Caroline said. Then she added
unnecessarily, &ldquo;You&mdash;you know Betty, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to know Betty,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other, with that look
of incredulity with which lovers sometimes
greet each other after absence and estrangement.
&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be you,&rdquo; their eyes seem to
be saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve disposed of you long since, God
help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Preston?&rdquo; Betty said, giving
him her hand. Then she smiled faintly, and
added with a caricature of her usual manner:
&ldquo;Lovely weather we&rsquo;re having for this time of
year, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' ></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of you, Betty,&rdquo;&mdash;Dick smiled
as she sank into the chair beside him and Preston
turned to his sister. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a little
sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you can, Dicky,&rdquo; she
smiled at him forlornly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bad black
heart, and I play the wrong kind of games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see through them, so it&rsquo;s all right.
What&rsquo;s this about Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later,&rdquo; Betty said; &ldquo;there she
comes now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy, stimulated by massage and steam, her
hair dressed by a professional; powdered, and
for the first time in her life rouged to hide the
tell-tale absence of her natural quickening color,
came forward to meet her guests in supreme
unconsciousness of the pathos of the effect she
had achieved. She was dressed in snowy white
like a bride,&mdash;the only gown she had that was
in keeping with the holiday decorations, and
she moved a little clumsily, as if her brain had
found itself suddenly in charge of an unfamiliar
set of reflexes. Her lids drooped over burning
eyes that had known no sleep for many nights,
and every line and lineament of her face was
stamped with pain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' ></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; she
said. Her voice, curiously, was the only natural
thing about her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been scouring off every
vestige of my work-a-day self, and that takes
time. Thank you for the roses, Dick, but the
only flowers I could have worn with this color
scheme would have been geraniums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you some geraniums to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do you do, Preston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a cold hand, and he stared at
her almost as he had stared at Betty. He was
a tall grave-looking youth, with Caroline&rsquo;s
straight features and olive coloring, and a shock
of heavy blond hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll like your party,&rdquo; Nancy hurried
on. &ldquo;Gaspard is bursting with pride in it.
I think it would be a nice thing to have him in
and drink his health after the coffee. He would
never forget the honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Dick said in an undertone to
Betty, &ldquo;how long has she been like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later,&rdquo; she promised him again.</p>
<p>With the serving of the first course of dinner&mdash;Gaspard&rsquo;s
wonderful <i>Pur&eacute;e Mongol</i>&mdash;an artist&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' ></a>265</span>
dream of all the most delicate vegetables in
the world mingled together as the clouds are
mingled, the tensity in the air seemed to break
and shatter about them in showers of brilliant,
artificial mirth, which presently, because they
were all young and fond of one another and
their group had the habit of intimacy, became
less and less strained and unreal.</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s tired eyes lost something of their
unnatural glitter, and Betty seemed more of a
woman than a scarlet sprite, while Caroline&rsquo;s
smile began to reflect something of the real
gladness that possessed her soul. Dick and
Billy took up the burden of the entertainment
of the party, and gave at least an excellent imitation
of inspirational gaiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>filet of sole</i>,&rdquo; Billy observed as he sampled
his second course appreciatively, &ldquo;is common
or barnyard flounder,&mdash;and the shrimp
and the oyster crab, and that mushroom of the
sea, and the other little creature in the corner
of my plate who shall be nameless, because I
have no idea what his name is,&mdash;are all put in
to make it harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaspard is using some of the simpler native
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' ></a>266</span>
products now instead of the high-priced imported
ones,&rdquo; Nancy said eagerly, &ldquo;and he is
getting wonderful results, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flounder <i>a la Fran&ccedil;aise</i> is all right,&rdquo; Dick
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our restaurant has reformed,&rdquo; Betty said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re running it on a strictly business basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And making money?&rdquo; Dick asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not losing much,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a great improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of those little girls from the publishing
houses look paler to me than they did,&rdquo;
Nancy said. &ldquo;I wish I could give them hypodermics
of protein and carbohydrates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the name and address of any of
your customers that worry you,&rdquo; Dick said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll buy &rsquo;em a cow or a sugar plum tree
or a flivver or anything else they seem to be in
need of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t those things tend to pauperize the
poor?&rdquo; Caroline&rsquo;s brother put in gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they do,&rdquo; Billy agreed, &ldquo;only Nancy
has kind of given up her struggle not to pauperize them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started in with some very high ideals about
scientific service,&rdquo; Nancy explained. &ldquo;I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' ></a>267</span>
never going to give anybody anything they
hadn&rsquo;t actually earned in some way, except to
bring up the average of normality by feeding
my patrons surreptitious calories. I had it all
figured out that the only legitimate charity was
putting flesh on the bones of the human race,&mdash;that
increasing the general efficiency that way
wasn&rsquo;t really charity at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that now?&rdquo; Preston Eustace
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I believe now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is scientific charity, anyhow?&rdquo; Dick
looked about inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such animal,&rdquo; Billy contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s substituting the cool human intellect for
the warm human heart, I guess,&rdquo; Betty said
dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that so often works,&rdquo; Caroline said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never going to make any mistakes,&rdquo;
Nancy said. &ldquo;I was going to keep my fists scientifically
shut, and my heart beatifically open.&rdquo;
She hesitated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was going to swing my
life, and my undertakings&mdash;right.&rdquo; It became
increasingly hard for her to speak, and a little
gasp went round the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' ></a>268</span>
nothing&mdash;nothing but mistakes,&rdquo; she finished
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve rectified them,&rdquo; Betty put in vigorously.
&ldquo;Nancy, dear, I&rsquo;ve never known you
to make a mistake that you haven&rsquo;t rectified,
and that is more than I can say of any other
person in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirloin and carrots,&rdquo; Caroline said, as the
next course came in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you&rsquo;ve cut
the price of this dinner in two by judicious
ordering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else but field salad,&rdquo; Nancy
said, still piteously, &ldquo;and raspberry <i>mousse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, you&rsquo;ll break my heart,&rdquo; Betty said,
wiping her eyes frankly, but Nancy only looked
at her wonderingly, wistfully, preoccupied and
remote, while Preston Eustace gazed at Betty
as if he too would find a welcome relief in shedding
a heavy tear or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collier Pratt has broken her heart, Dick,&rdquo;
Betty told him in the limousine on the way
home. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been going on ever since the first
time she saw him. Down at the restaurant
we&rsquo;ve all known it. She&rsquo;s been eating at his
table every night for months, and Gaspard and
everybody else in the place, in fact, has been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' ></a>269</span>
slave to his lightest whim. I&rsquo;ve always disliked
him intensely, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my business to tell you. I thought
it was coming off, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was coming off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their affair. I thought it was past my
meddling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you thought Nancy
was going to marry Collier Pratt&mdash;<i>Nancy</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, if I hadn&rsquo;t I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
acted up the way I did in your rooms that
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick neither heard nor understood her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you think Collier
Pratt has been making love to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the damned scoundrel is married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Betty cried. &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always known it,&rdquo; Dick
said. &ldquo;I never dreamed that Nancy had any
special interest in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she had. She&rsquo;s going through everything,
Dick, even Sheila&mdash;you know how she
loved Sheila?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' ></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dick said grimly. &ldquo;Do you mind
going on home alone, Betty? You&rsquo;ll be perfectly
safe with Williams, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. What are you going to do,
Dick? Are you going to Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty, looking at him more closely, realized
for the first time that she was sitting beside a
man in whom the rage of the primitive animal
was gaining its ascendency. His breath was
coming in short stertorous gasps, his hands
were clinched, the purplish color was mounting
to his brows, but he still went through the motions
of a courteous leave-taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Dick?&rdquo; she asked
again, as he stood on the curb where he had
signaled Williams to leave him, with the door
of the car in his hand, staring down at it, and
for the moment forgetting to close it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find Collier Pratt,&rdquo; he said
thickly. Then with a slam that splintered the
hinge of the door he was holding he crashed it
in toward the car.</p></div>

<a  id='CHAPTER_XIX_OTHER_PEOPLES_TROUBLES'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Other People&rsquo;s Troubles</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Nancy was trying conscientiously to interest
herself in other people&rsquo;s troubles.
After the first great shock of pain following
her loss at a blow of her lover and Sheila, she
began automatically to try to work her way
through her suffering. The habit of application
to the daily task combined with her instinct for
taking immediate action in a crisis stood her in
good stead in her hour of need. She decided
what to occupy herself with, and then devoted
herself faithfully to the prescribed occupation.</p>
<p>The Inn did not need her. With Betty to
guide him economically Gaspard was able to
superintend all the details of the establishment
adequately and artistically. Sheila was gone.
She packed up several trunks of dresses and
toys and other childish belongings and sent
them to Washington Square, but even without
these constant reminders of her, the hunger
for the child&rsquo;s presence did not abate. The little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' ></a>272</span>
girl was curiously dissociated from her father
in Nancy&rsquo;s mind. She had seen so little
of the two together that they seemed to belong
to entirely different compartments of her consciousness.
It was only the anguish of losing
them that linked them together.</p>
<p>Nancy decided to devote a certain proportion
of her days and nights to remedying such evils
as lay under her immediate observation;&mdash;to
helping the individuals with whom she came
into daily contact&mdash;the dependents and tradespeople
with whom she dealt. She had always
been convinced that the people who ministered
to her daily comfort in New York should occupy
some part in her scheme of existence. It was
one of her favorite arguments that a little more
energy and imagination on the part of New
York citizens would develop the communal
spirit which was so painfully lacking in the
soul of the average Manhattanite.</p>
<p>So the milkman and the corner grocer, the
newspaper man, and Hitty&rsquo;s small brood of
grand nieces and nephews, to say nothing of the
Italian fruit man&rsquo;s family, and her laundress&rsquo;s
invalid daughter, were all occupying a considerable
place in Nancy&rsquo;s daily schedule. In a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' ></a>273</span>
very short interval she had the welfare of more
than half a dozen families on her hands, and
was involved in all manner of enterprises of a
domestic nature,&mdash;from the designing of confirmation
gowns to the purchase of rubber-tired
rolling chairs, and heterogeneous woolen garments
and other intimate necessities.</p>
<p>She was a little ashamed of her new line of
activities, and still hurt enough to shun the
scrutiny of her friends, and thereby succeeded
in mystifying and alarming Billy and Dick and
Betty and Caroline almost beyond the limit of
their endurance by resolutely keeping them at
arm&rsquo;s length. She was supremely unconscious
of anything at all remarkable in her behavior,
and believed that they accepted her excuses and
apologies at their face value. She had no conception
of the fact that her tortured face, with
tragedy looking newly out of her eyes, kept
them from their rest at night.</p>
<p>Sheila wrote to thank her for sending the
trunks.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;My dear, <i>ma ch&egrave;re</i>, Miss Dear,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;<i>Merci beaucoup pour</i> my clothes and other
beautiful things. I like them. <i>Je t&rsquo;aime&mdash;je
t&rsquo;aime toujours</i>. My father will not permit me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' ></a>274</span>
to go back. <i>Comme</i>&mdash;how I desire to see you!
My father has been sick. He fell down or was
hurt in the street. There was blood&mdash;a great
deal. Are they well&mdash;the others? Tell Monsieur
Dick I give him <i>tout mon coeur</i>. Come to
see me if it is <i>permit</i>. No more. You could
write <i>peut-&ecirc;tre</i>. <i>Je t&rsquo;aime</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Yours,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Sheila.</span>&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Nancy read this letter, in the quaint childish
hand, with a great wave of dumb sickness
creeping over her&mdash;a devastating, disintegrating
nausea of soul and body. The most significant
fact in it, however, that Collier Pratt had
fallen down &ldquo;or been hurt in the street,&rdquo; of
course escaped her entirely, except to stir her
with a kind of dim pity for his distress.</p>
<p>In one of her long night vigils Preston Eustace&rsquo;s
face came back to her oddly. She remembered
suddenly the strange sad way he had
stared at Betty on the evening of her party at
the Inn. She reconstructed Betty&rsquo;s love-story,
and its sudden breaking off, three years before,
and with her new insight into the human heart,
decided that these two loved each other still,
and must be helped to the consummation of
their happiness. She telephoned to them both
the next day that they could be of service to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' ></a>275</span>
her; and made an appointment to meet them at
a given hour the next evening at her apartment.</p>
<p>She expected and intended to be there herself
to give the meeting the semblance of coincidence,
and to offer them the hospitality of her
house before she was inspired with the excuse
that would permit her an exit that left them
alone together; but she found herself in the
slums of Harlem by an Italian baby&rsquo;s bedside at
that hour, and decided that even to telephone
would be superfluous, as once finding each other
the lovers would be oblivious to all other considerations.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that Preston
Eustace, exactly on time as was his habit, had
been waiting some ten minutes on Nancy&rsquo;s
hearth-rug when Betty, delayed by the eccentricities
of a casual motor-bus engine, and frantic
with anxiety for her friend, burst in upon
him. So full was she of the most hectic speculations
concerning Nancy&rsquo;s sudden appeal to
her that she scarcely noticed who was waiting
there to greet her, and when she did notice,
scarcely heeded that recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nancy?&rdquo; she demanded breathlessly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' ></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Betty,&rdquo; Preston Eustace said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Hitty know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sent for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably sent for everybody else,&rdquo;
Betty said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s killed herself, I know she
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her heart is broken, she&rsquo;s been suffering
terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she would have sent for me
if she had been going to kill herself,&rdquo; Preston
Eustace said, a little as if he would have added,
&ldquo;We are not on those terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she would,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;But
oh, Preston, I&rsquo;m so worried about her. I don&rsquo;t
know where she is or anything. I tell you her
heart is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you believed in hearts&mdash;broken
or otherwise, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in Nancy&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never believed in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never gave me much reason to, Preston.
You&mdash;you let me give you back your ring the
first time I threatened to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' ></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never came near me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let three years go by without a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say &lsquo;of course I did&rsquo; again I&rsquo;ll fly
straight up through this roof. If you&rsquo;d ever
loved me you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone away and
left me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t loved you I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Betty sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how
you can stand there and think about yourself
with Nancy out in the night&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know
where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ourselves, Betty&mdash;did you ever really love
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference whether I
did or not,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;I hate men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better be going,&rdquo; Preston Eustace
said, his face dark with pain. He was
rather a literal-minded young man, as Caroline&rsquo;s
brother would have been likely to be.</p>
<p>Betty buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head aches,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I was never
in my life so mad and so miserable. I can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' ></a>278</span>
understand why everything and everybody
should behave so&mdash;devilishly. You and every
one else, I mean. I just simply can&rsquo;t bear to
have Nancy suffer so. My head aches and my
heart aches and my soul aches.&rdquo; She lifted her
head defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had better be going,&rdquo; Preston Eustace
repeated, looking down at her sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t be going,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;What in
the name of sense do you want to be going for?&rdquo;
Then without warning or premeditation she
hurled herself at his breast. &ldquo;Oh! Preston, if
there is anything comforting in this world,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;tell it to me, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preston Eustace gathered her to his breast
with infinite tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said with his lips on her
brow. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that comfort you a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; winding her arms
about his neck, &ldquo;but you have no idea what a
little devil I am, Preston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have any idea,&rdquo; he said, still
holding her hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you do,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;Oh!
kiss me again, dear, and tell me you won&rsquo;t ever
let me go now.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' ></a>279</span></div>
<p>When Nancy came in she found the lovers so
oblivious to the sound of her key in the latch or
her footstep in the corridor that she decided to
slip into bed without disturbing them, and did
so, without their ever realizing that for the latter
part of the evening at least, they had a
hostess within range of the sound of their voices&mdash;indeed,
she was obliged to stuff the pillow
into her ears to prevent herself from actually
hearing what they were saying.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At first her freedom&mdash;her release from the
monotonous constraint of her daily confinement
at the Inn&mdash;the unaccustomed independence of
her new activities which justified her most
untoward goings and comings&mdash;was very soothing
to her. She liked the feeling of slipping out
of the house at night, accountable to no one
except the redoubtable Hitty to whom she presented
any explanation that happened to occur
to her,&mdash;however wide its departure from the
actual facts&mdash;and losing herself in the resurgent
town. But after a while her liberty lost its
savor. She began to feel uncared for and neglected.
The unaccountable anguish in her
breast was neither assuaged nor mitigated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' ></a>280</span>
the geographical latitude she permitted herself.
She kept doggedly on with her personally conducted
philanthropies, but she began to feel a
little frightened about her capacity for endurance.
Her body and brain began to show
strange signs of fatigue. She was afraid that
one or the other might suddenly refuse to
function.</p>
<p>One night, on coming out into the heterogeneous
human stream on Avenue A, after a visit
to a Polish family in the model tenements on
Seventy-ninth Street, she ran into Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what an extraordinary
place to find you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My business often
brings me up this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your business? What business?&rdquo; she asked
incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what business it is.
The ministering business, I guess.&rdquo; He motioned
toward the basket on her arm: &ldquo;Let me
carry that, and you, too, if you&rsquo;ll let me, Nancy.
You look tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired, Dick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you got
a car anywhere around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can phone for it in two shakes,&rdquo; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' ></a>281</span>
&ldquo;Here in this ice-cream parlor. Can I buy you
a cone while you&rsquo;re waiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy cones for that crowd of children and I&rsquo;ll
watch them eat them. Doesn&rsquo;t that little girl
in the pink dress look like Sheila, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank down on a stool in the interior of
the candy shop and rested her elbows on the
damp marble table in front of her, splotched
and streaked still with the refreshment of the
last customer who occupied the seat there and
watched the horde of dirty clamorous street
children devouring ice-cream cones and cheap
sweets to the limit of their capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you believed in this promiscuous
feeding of children between meals,&rdquo; Dick
said, when she was settled comfortably at last
among the cushions of his car, which had arrived
on the scene with an amazing, not to say,
suspicious promptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;in the least; but I
don&rsquo;t <i>really</i> believe in the things I believe in
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Nancy!&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some trouble, Dick. I&rsquo;m shaken all
out of my poise. I can&rsquo;t seem to get my universe
straight again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' ></a>282</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anything I
can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by; that&rsquo;s all, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t tell me a little more about it,
could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even to guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t guess. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing
that&rsquo;s entirely outside of&mdash;of the probabilities.
I think it&rsquo;s outside of the range of your understanding,
Dick. I don&rsquo;t think you know that
there is exactly that kind of trouble in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think you&rsquo;d better not enlighten
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, Dick, even if I wanted to. Funny
you happened to be in this part of town to-night
just when I really needed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled. Every night of his life he followed her,
watching over her, dodging down
dark alley ways, waiting at squalid entrances
until she came out. To-night he had ventured
to speak to her only because he knew her to be
in need of actual physical assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully glad to be anywhere around when
you need me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;still I hope you don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' ></a>283</span>
mind my suggesting that this is a Gehenna of a
place for either of us to be in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any feeling for the downtrodden?&rdquo;
Nancy asked, with a faint reflection of
what Billy referred to as her &ldquo;older and better
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m downtrodden myself, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled in her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look very downtrodden to me,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> got everything to live for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, money and freedom and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money is the only thing I&rsquo;ve got that you
haven&rsquo;t, and that doesn&rsquo;t mean much unless you
can share it with the person you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t, does it?&rdquo; Nancy said unexpectedly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that scar on your forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a scratch I got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shaving or fighting, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was</i> it fighting, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were you fighting with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t fighting. I was assaulting and
battering.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' ></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any satisfaction to you to know it I
made one grand job of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it be any satisfaction to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick!&rdquo; Nancy said again. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you had any of that kind of brutality in
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens to a man when he&mdash;does a
thing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gets jugged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get jugged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t the part that interested
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An odd picture presented itself to Nancy&rsquo;s
mind of the men of the world engaged in one
grand m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of brawling; struggling, belaying
one another with their bare fists, drawing
blood; brutes turned on brutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are queer things,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face was turned away from her. It
was not at the moment a face she would have
recognized. The eyes were contracted: the
nostrils quivering: the teeth set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always at your service, Nancy,&rdquo; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' ></a>285</span>
presently. &ldquo;Is there anything in the world you
want that I can get for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I want is something you
can&rsquo;t get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get Sheila for you.
I&rsquo;m sorry. I suppose that&rsquo;s the whole answer
to you,&rdquo; he went on musingly. &ldquo;You want
something, somebody to mother&mdash;to minister
to. It doesn&rsquo;t make so much difference what
else it is, so long as it&rsquo;s&mdash;downtrodden. That&rsquo;s
why I&rsquo;ve never made more of a hit with you.
I&rsquo;ve never been downtrodden enough. I didn&rsquo;t
need feeding or nursing. I&rsquo;ve always sort of
cherished the feeling that I liked to be the one
creature you didn&rsquo;t have to carry on your back.
I thought that to stand behind <i>you</i> was a pretty
good stunt, but you&rsquo;ve never needed anything
yet to fall back on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever shall,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;Not,&mdash;not in the way you mean, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; he said, folding his arms. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s still one thing you&rsquo;ll take from me, and
that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve got that you haven&rsquo;t&mdash;money.
I never have cared much about it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' ></a>286</span>
before, but now that there are so many things
I can&rsquo;t put right for you, I know you won&rsquo;t be
selfish enough to deny this one satisfaction.
Let me make over to you all the money you need
to get you out of your difficulties with the Inn.
Let me hand out a good round sum for all these
charities of yours. If you knew how everything
else in connection with you had conspired
to hurt me,&mdash;how this being discounted and losing
out all around has cut into me, you wouldn&rsquo;t
deny me this one privilege. You don&rsquo;t want
<i>me</i>, you wouldn&rsquo;t take me, but for God&rsquo;s sake,
Nancy, take this one thing that I can give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had just swung into the lower entrance
of the Park, and the big car was speeding silently
into the deepening night, low hung with
silver stars, and jeweled with soft lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully good to me, Dick,&rdquo; Nancy
said, &ldquo;and I appreciate every word you&rsquo;ve been
saying. I&rsquo;d take your money, not for myself,
but for the things I&rsquo;m doing, if I needed it, but
I don&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo; She looked out into the
coolness of the evening, lulled by the transition
to a region of so much airiness and space,
soothed by the soft motion, and the presence of
a friend who loved her. The conversation in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' ></a>287</span>
which she was engaged suddenly became trivial
and unimportant to her. She was very tired,
and she found herself beginning to rest and
relax. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; she repeated vaguely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got plenty of money of my own. Over a
million, Billy says now. Uncle Elijah left it to
me. I didn&rsquo;t want him to, but perhaps it was
all for the best.&rdquo; She put her head back against
the cushions and shut her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly
sleepy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and as for the Inn&mdash;that&rsquo;s
making money, too, you know. Last month we
cleared more than two hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dick saying nothing, but continuing to
stare into space&mdash;the panoramic space fleeting
rhythmically by the car window,&mdash;she let herself
gradually slip into the depths of sudden
drowsiness that had overtaken her.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Hitty</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Hitty put on her bonnet&mdash;she had worn
widow&rsquo;s weeds for twenty-five years&mdash;and
went out into the morning. She finally
succeeded in boarding a south-bound Sixth
Avenue car,&mdash;though since it was her habit to
ignore the near side stop regulation, she always
had considerable trouble in getting on any car,&mdash;and
in seating herself bolt upright on the
lengthwise seat, her black gloved hands folded
indomitably before her.</p>
<p>At Fourth Street she descended and made
her way east to the square, and thence to the
top floor of the studio building to which Collier
Pratt had taken his little daughter on the memorable
occasion when he had plucked her from
her warm nest of blankets and led her, sleepy
and shivering, into the cold of the night. She
had been at some pains to secure the address
without taking Nancy into her confidence.</p>
<p>She took each creaking stair with a snort of
disgust, and reaching the battered door with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' ></a>289</span>
Collier Pratt&rsquo;s visiting card tacked on the
smeary panel on a level with her eye, she
knocked sharply, and scorning to wait for a reply,
turned the knob and walked in.</p>
<p>Collier Pratt was making coffee on a small
spirit lamp, set on the wash-stand, which was
decorously concealed during the more formal
hours of the day behind a soft colored Japanese
screen. He was wearing a smutty painter&rsquo;s
smock, and though his face was shining with
soap and water, his hair was standing about
his face in a disorder eloquent of at least a
dozen hours&rsquo; neglect. Sheila, in a mussy gingham
dress, was trying to pry off the pasteboard
covering of a pint bottle of milk with a pair of
scissors, and succeeding only indifferently. They
both turned on Hitty&rsquo;s entrance, and the milk
bottle went crashing to the floor when the little
girl recognized her friend, but after one terrified
look at her father she made no move at all
in Hitty&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to what,&rdquo; Collier Pratt ejaculated
slowly and disagreeably, as is any man&rsquo;s wont
before he has had his draught of breakfast
coffee, &ldquo;am I to attribute the pleasure of this
visit?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' ></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no pleasure to me,&rdquo; Hitty said, advancing,
a figure of menace, into the center of
the dusty workshop, strangely uncouth and unprepossessing
in the cold morning light,&mdash;&ldquo;and
if it&rsquo;s any pleasure to you, that&rsquo;s an effect that
I ain&rsquo;t calculated to produce. I&rsquo;ve come here on
business&mdash;the business of collecting that poor
neglected child there, and taking her back
where she belongs, where there&rsquo;s folks that
knows enough to treat her right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of Miss Martin&rsquo;s friends and well-wishers,
I take it. These American girls are
given to surrounding themselves with groups
of warm and impulsive associates. Do you by
any chance happen to know a young lawyer by
the name of Boynton, Hitty? A collection
lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you to call me Mrs. Spinney, if you
please, or if you don&rsquo;t please. Mrs. Spinney is
the name I go by when I&rsquo;m spoken to by them
that knows their manners. If Billy Boynton
thinks he can collect blood out of a stone he&rsquo;s
welcome to try, but I should think he was too
long headed to waste his time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave him my I. O. U.,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said
wearily. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, Hitty,&mdash;I really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' ></a>291</span>
must be excused from your inexcusable surname&mdash;I
am going to drink a cup of coffee before
we continue this interesting discussion&mdash;<i>caf&eacute;
noir</i>, our late unfortunate accident depriving
me of <i>caf&eacute; au lait</i> as usual. Sheila, get the
cups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you feed that
peaked child with full strength coffee, do you?
It&rsquo;ll stunt her growth; ain&rsquo;t you got the sense
to know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like <i>big</i> women,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very fond of coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ve come to get her and take her
away where you won&rsquo;t be in a position to stunt
her growth, whatever your ideas on the subject
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collier Pratt seated himself at the deal table
that Sheila had set with the coffee-cups and a
big loaf of French bread, and began slowly
consuming a bowl of inky fluid, strong of chicory,
into which from time to time he dipped a
portion of the loaf. Sheila imitated his processes
with less daintiness and precision, since
she was shaken with excitement at Hitty&rsquo;s
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should spread a newspaper down if I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' ></a>292</span>
you,&rdquo; Hitty said, &ldquo;before I et my vittles off a
table that way. If a table ain&rsquo;t scrubbed as
often as twice a day it ain&rsquo;t fit to be et off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your breed,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be capable of taking your breakfast off
<i>The Evening Telegram</i> if no more appropriately
colored sheet were at hand. Tell me, did Miss
Martin send you here this morning, or was the
inspiration to come entirely your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody had to send me. Wild horses
wouldn&rsquo;t have kept me away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor drag you away from here, I suppose,
until your gruesome visit is accomplished.
What makes you think that I would give up
Sheila to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> you would. I know you&rsquo;re
a-goin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want the child. You don&rsquo;t want her,
and you can&rsquo;t pretend to me that you do. Even
if you did want her you can&rsquo;t take care of her
in no way that&rsquo;s decent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal in what you say, Hitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re going to do is to sign a paper
giving up your claim to her, and then Nancy
can adopt her when she sees fitting to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' ></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What would you suggest my doing about the
child&rsquo;s mother? She has a mother living, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hitty said, &ldquo;but now
I do know I guess I ain&rsquo;t going to have so much
trouble as I thought I was. You&rsquo;re just a plain
low-down yellow cur that any likely man I know
would come down here and lick the lights out
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t send any more of them, Hitty,&rdquo;
Collier Pratt protested. &ldquo;My work won&rsquo;t
stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;tend to the child&rsquo;s mother then, and
I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;tend to you. You&rsquo;d better let Sheila come
away peaceable without any more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose doing to me if I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many different things I could
use,&rdquo; Hitty said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t
know which one to hold over your head first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could use anything
you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon use something I hadn&rsquo;t got,&rdquo;
Hitty said grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sue you for breach o&rsquo;
promise myself ruther than lose what I come
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you&rsquo;re capable of it,&rdquo; Collier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' ></a>294</span>
Pratt said, surveying her ruefully. &ldquo;That certainly
would ruin my reputation. But seriously,
supposing I were to give my consent to
Sheila&rsquo;s going back to Miss Martin&mdash;Sheila&rsquo;s
fond of her, and I should be very glad to do
Miss Martin a service&mdash;little as you may be inclined
to believe it of me. I&rsquo;m fond enough of
the child, but she is a considerable embarrassment
to a man situated as I am. Supposing I
should consent to giving her up as you suggest,
how can a woman situated as Miss Martin is
situated undertake such a charge permanently?
How could she afford it? What kind of a future
should I be surrendering my little girl to?
One has to think of those things. Miss Martin is
a poor girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lucky thing that you didn&rsquo;t know it
before,&rdquo; Hitty said deliberately. &ldquo;What you
don&rsquo;t know that a woman&rsquo;s got, you wouldn&rsquo;t be
trying to get away from her. Nancy&rsquo;s Uncle
Elijah that died last year left her a million
dollars in his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess if anybody&rsquo;s going to talk about
devils it had better be me,&rdquo; Hitty said dryly.
&ldquo;Does the child go or stay?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' ></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she goes,&rdquo; Collier Pratt said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry you didn&rsquo;t come after me too, Hitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody from up our way is ever coming
after you. You can put that in your pipe and
smoke it. Put on your bonnet, Sheila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways that is more of a relief than
you know, Hitty. Some of the young men from
up your way are so violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t generally known yet,&rdquo; Hitty said as
a parting shot when, Sheila&rsquo;s hand in hers, she
stood at the door preparatory to taking her
triumphal departure. &ldquo;But Nancy is going to
marry considerable money in addition to what
she&rsquo;s inherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy finding it impossible to spend an hour
of her time idly and with no appointments before
noon that day, was engaged in darning a
basket full of slum socks that she had brought
home from the tenements to occupy Hitty&rsquo;s leisure
moments. She was not very expert at
this particular task, and the holes were so huge,
and their method of behaving under scientific
management so peculiar&mdash;it is hardly necessary
to say that Nancy knew the theory of
darning perfectly&mdash;that she was becoming more
and more dissatisfied with her progress. Hitty&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' ></a>296</span>
unprecedented and taciturn donning of her best
bonnet in the early morning hours, followed by
her abrupt departure without explanation or
apology, was also a little disconcerting to any
one acquainted with her habits. Nancy was relieved
to hear her key in the lock again, and put
down her work to greet her.</p>
<p>The door opened and Sheila stood on the
threshold. Hitty was close behind her, but
Nancy had eyes only for the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Miss Dear,&rdquo; Sheila said, in her
arms. &ldquo;I cried hard every night when I was
gone from you, but now I have come back. My
father does not want me, and he says that you
can have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He signed a paper,&rdquo; Hitty said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
it in my bag with my specs. If ever he shows
his face around here we can have the law on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I really have Sheila?&rdquo; Nancy cried. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t believe that&mdash;her father would let her go.
I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a kind of a poor soul,&rdquo; Hitty said. &ldquo;He
ain&rsquo;t got no real contrivance. He&rsquo;s glad enough
to get rid of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' ></a>297</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nearabout. He has a high-falutin way
of talking but that was the amount of it. He
knows which side his bread is buttered. He
ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s fool. I&rsquo;ll say that for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that you make him out a very
pleasant character,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s an
artist, Hitty. Artists don&rsquo;t react to the same
set of laws that we do. They&rsquo;re different somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t so different, when it comes to
that,&rdquo; Hitty said dryly. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take a
hint, but the harder you kick &rsquo;em the better for
all concerned. Don&rsquo;t you go sticking up for
that low-down loon. He ain&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
pretty poor apology for a man as we understand
men, Hitty, but there&rsquo;s something about him,&mdash;a
power and a charm that you can&rsquo;t altogether
discount, even though you have lost every particle
of your respect for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a kind of way,&rdquo; Hitty conceded, &ldquo;but
I ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; them kind o&rsquo; women that hankers
much for the society of a man that&rsquo;s once shown
himself to be more of a sneak than the average.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I am, either,&rdquo; Nancy said
gravely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' ></a>298</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be your little girl always,&rdquo; Sheila
announced, &ldquo;if I may talk now, may I? And
Monsieur Dick&rsquo;s, too, and sit on a cushion and
sew a fine seam, and feast upon strawberries,
sugar and cream. I want to see Monsieur Dick.
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been sick,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s getting
better now, I think. I haven&rsquo;t seen him
for some time, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love him very much and aren&rsquo;t
you very sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably isn&rsquo;t very sick,&rdquo; Nancy said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he could be&mdash;but if he were I
should be sorry, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to be sick,&rdquo; Sheila said,
making herself a nest in Nancy&rsquo;s lap, and curling
around in it like a kitten. &ldquo;If he was I
should be very, very unhappy, and I am tired
of being unhappy, Miss Dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s arms closed tight about her little
body, which was lighter in her arms than she
had ever known it. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m going to make
such a strong well, little girl of you,&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to have so many pleasant
times together. I&rsquo;m tired of being unhappy,
too, Sheila, dear.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='smcap'>Lohengrin and White Satin</span></span></h2>
</div>
<div class='text'><p class='ni'>Dick, having la grippe, and doing his
bewildered best to get pneumonia and gastritis
by creeping out of bed when his temperature
was highest, and indulging in untrammelled
orgies of food and drink and exposure to
draughts, had finally succeeded in making himself
physically very miserable indeed. His
mind had been out of joint for weeks. He
reached the phase presently of refusing all
nourishment and spiritual consolation, indiscriminately,
and finding himself unbenefited by
these heroic methods, decided in his own mind
that all was over with him.</p>
<p>He knew nothing about sickness, having led
a charmed life in that respect since the measles
period, and the persistent misery in his interior,
attacking lung and liver impartially,&mdash;to
say nothing of the top of his head and the back
of his neck, and as his weakness increased, his
cardiac region where there was a perpetual palpitation,
and the calves of his legs which set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' ></a>300</span>
up an ache like that of a recalcitrant tooth,&mdash;persuaded
him that such suffering as his must
be a certain indication of the approaching end.
He had dismissed his doctor after the first visit,
and denying himself to visitors, found himself
alone and apparently in a desperate condition,
with no one to minister to him but paid dependents.
It was then that the loss of Nancy
began to assume spectral proportions. He had
been so long accustomed to think of himself as
the strong silent lover, equipped with the patience
and understanding that would outlast all
the vagaries of Nancy&rsquo;s adventurous tendencies,
that it was difficult to readjust himself to a new
conception of her as a woman that another and
even less worthy man had so nearly won,&mdash;under
his nose.</p>
<p>He had never thought much of his money
until it began to acquire the virtue of an alkahest
in his mind, an universal solvent that
would transmute all the baser metals in Nancy&rsquo;s
life and the lives of the people in whom Nancy
was interested, into the pure gold of luxury and
ease. He knew that the conventional fairy gifts
would mean very little to her, but he had dreamed,
when she was ready, of working out with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' ></a>301</span>
her some practicable and gracious scheme of
beneficence. There was one power she coveted
that he could put in her hands,&mdash;one way that
he could befriend and relieve her even before
she conceded him that prerogative. When he
learned that she had a fortune of her own his
hopes came tumbling about his head, and he lay
disconsolate among the ruins. His creeping
physical disability seemed significant of the
cataclysmic overthrow of all his dreams and
desires. From having secretly and in some
terror arrived at the conclusion that death was
imminent, he began to look upon such a solution
of his misery with some favor.</p>
<p>It was a very gaunt and hollow-eyed caricature
of the Dick she had known that confronted
Nancy, when instigated by Betty, who
had his illness heavily on her mind, she forced
her way unannounced into the curious Georgian
living-room of the suite wherein he was incarcerated.
He had been stretched in an attitude
of abandon on the couch when she opened the
oak paneled door, but he jumped to his feet in
a spasm of rage and alarm when he discovered
that he had a visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not able to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' ></a>302</span>
anybody. There&rsquo;s a mistake. I gave strict
orders that nobody at all was to be admitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Dick,&rdquo; Nancy said gently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
blame your faithful servitors. I thought I
should have to use a gun on them, but I explained
to them that you must be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be looked after. I&rsquo;m all
right, thank you. Are you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Hitty&rsquo;s outside. Betty simply insisted
on my bringing her,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why, but
she said you&rsquo;d be kinder to me if I did. I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flicker of a smile crossed Dick&rsquo;s face, which
seemed to say that if anything could bring back
a momentary relish of existence the mention of
Betty&rsquo;s name would be that thing. Nancy saw
the expression and misinterpreted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody,&rdquo; Dick repeated
firmly. &ldquo;Will you be good enough to go away
and leave me to my misery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nancy said, &ldquo;I never left anybody
to their misery yet, and I&rsquo;m not going to
begin on you. Of course, if you&rsquo;d rather see
Betty, I&rsquo;ll send for her. She seems to know a
good deal about your habits and customs. You
look like a monk in that bathrobe. I&rsquo;m glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' ></a>303</span>
you&rsquo;re not a fat man, Dick. It&rsquo;s so very hard to
calculate just how much to cut down on starches
and sweets without injury to the health. What
are you feeding up on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well that I&rsquo;m not feeding
up on anything, but if you think you can come
around here, and dope out one of your darned
health menus for me, and sit around watching
me eat it, you are jolly well mistaken. I wish
you&rsquo;d go home, Nancy. I don&rsquo;t like you to-day.
I don&rsquo;t like myself or anybody in this whole
universe. I&rsquo;m not fit for human society&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see I&rsquo;m not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awful cross, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me dear. I&rsquo;m not Sheila or one
of your sick waitresses, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheila&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s unique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me once there were other girls,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all over it by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, can&rsquo;t I do something for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' ></a>304</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you like this before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were ever anything but
sort of smug and superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be in bed, dear&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to call you dear, it slipped out, Dicky,&mdash;and taking
nourishment every hour or so. What does
the doctor say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, he&rsquo;s given me up as a bad job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given you up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s nothing he can do for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick, my dear, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! lungs or liver or something. I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you taking, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I can&rsquo;t take anything,&rdquo; he said,
misunderstanding her. &ldquo;It makes me sick to
eat. Every time I try to eat anything I feel a
lot worse for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you try last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yesterday some time. Now what in the
name of sense makes a woman shed tears at a
simple statement like that? I&rsquo;m not in shape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' ></a>305</span>
to stand this. Once and for all, Nancy, will
you get out and leave me? I tell you I never
wanted to see you less in my life. I&rsquo;ll write
you a letter and apologize if you&rsquo;ll only go,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t really
believe that you wanted me to,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started for the door&mdash;but Dick, weakened
by lack of food, tortured beyond his endurance
by the sudden assault on his nerves made by
Nancy&rsquo;s appearance, gave way to his relief at
her going an instant too soon. Like a small
boy in pain he crooked his elbow and covered
his face with his arm.</p>
<p>Nancy ran to him and knelt at his side, taking
his head on her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you do want me. We want
each other. You love me, Dicky, and I am going
to love you&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll only let me look after
you and nurse you back to health again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be nursed,&rdquo; Dick blubbered,
his head buried in her bosom, &ldquo;I want to look
out for you, and take care of you, and&mdash;and
now look at me. You&rsquo;ll never love me after this,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' ></a>306</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall, dear,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
loved you somehow. It&rsquo;ll&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be the saving
of me, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I do want to be nursed. I&mdash;I
haven&rsquo;t cried before since I had the measles,
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you cried, now, then,&rdquo; Nancy said.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll want to be married in the
courtyard of the Inn,&rdquo; Dick said some weeks
later, when they were conventionally ensconced
in Nancy&rsquo;s own drawing-room; Hitty happily
rattling silverware in the butler&rsquo;s pantry in the
rear, &ldquo;with old Triton blowing his wreathed
horn above us, and all the nymphs and gargoyles
and Hercules as interested spectators.
Well, go as far as you like. I haven&rsquo;t any
objection. I&rsquo;ll be married in a Roman bath if
you want me to, and eat bran biscuit and hygienic
apple sauce for my wedding breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty and Preston are going to be married
at the Inn,&rdquo; Nancy said; &ldquo;you know her
mother&rsquo;s an invalid, and they can&rsquo;t have it at
home. Do you know what I&rsquo;d like to give them
as a wedding present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' ></a>307</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Preston&rsquo;s firm has gone out
of existence. The war simply killed it. They
haven&rsquo;t much money ahead, and he may have
a harder time than he thinks getting located
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d like to give them Outside
Inn for a wedding present. Besides, I don&rsquo;t
see what else there is to do with it. It&rsquo;s making
several hundred a month, now, and promises
to make more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem exceedingly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am,&rdquo; Dick said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more interested in
our wedding than Betty&rsquo;s wedding present, but
that doesn&rsquo;t imply a lack of merit in your idea.
<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> want to be married at the Inn, I take
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d let me, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;d let you. When a man marries a
modern girl with all the trappings and the
suits of modernity, he ought to be prepared to
take the consequences cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to surprise you. I don&rsquo;t
want anything modern at all about my wedding.
I want it in church with a huge bridal bouquet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' ></a>308</span>
and <i>Lohengrin</i> and white satin; Caroline
for my matron of honor and Betty for my
bridesmaid, and Sheila for flower girl. I want
a wedding breakfast at the Ritz and rice and
old shoes&mdash;just all the old traditional things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz,&rdquo; Dick ejaculated, &ldquo;is this
straight, or are you only making it up to sound
good to me? You can have it anyway you like
it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I like it,&rdquo; Nancy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
good to be a modern girl, but I really prefer to
be an old-fashioned wife&mdash;with reservations,&rdquo;
she added hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we all come to in the end,&rdquo;
Dick said, &ldquo;no matter how we feel or think
we feel about it&mdash;being modern with reservations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Collier Pratt to-day,&rdquo; Nancy said
suddenly, as she watched a log split apart in the
fireplace and scatter its tiny shower of sparks,
&ldquo;on the avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick carefully stamped out two smoldering
places on the rug before he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a cheap little creature with him,
dark haired in messy cerise.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' ></a>309</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been his wife. I hear that she&rsquo;s
living with him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; Dick said with an effort, after a
few minutes of silence, &ldquo;are you all over that?
Is it really fair and right of me to take you?
I&rsquo;ve been puzzling over that lately. I want you
on any terms, you know, as far as I am concerned,
but I&rsquo;m a sort of monogamist. If a
woman has once cared for a person, no matter
who or what that person is, can she ever care
again in the same way for any one? Isn&rsquo;t it
pity you feel for me, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it isn&rsquo;t pity,&rdquo; Nancy said slowly. &ldquo;I
cared for that man until I found that he was
the shadow and not the substance. He isn&rsquo;t
fit to black your shoes, Dick.&mdash;Besides&mdash;if&mdash;if
it was pity,&rdquo; she added irrelevantly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
way to get me started, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only have got you started&mdash;really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy crossed the two feet of space between
them and sank at his feet, leaning her head
back against his knee while he stroked her
hair silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one way of proving,&rdquo; she said presently,
&ldquo;if&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve made a woman really care
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' ></a>310</span>
for you. I should think you&rsquo;d know that. I
told you how you&rsquo;d made me feel about the bridal
bouquet and <i>Lohengrin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that prove something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it does. You mean it proves
that a woman truly loves a man if he&rsquo;s made
her feel that she wants to be an old-fashioned
wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mother, Dick,&rdquo; Nancy finished for him
bravely.</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;'>THE END</p></div>
